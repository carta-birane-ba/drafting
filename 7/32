## <center>LIMITED PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT</center>
<br> 
THIS LIMITED PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT (this “**Agreement**”) dated as {{now | date('DD MMMM YYYY') }} is entered into by the Fund, a series of {{carta.master_entity_name}}, a Delaware multi-series limited partnership (the “**Master Partnership**”), {{carta.gp_entity_name}}, a Delaware limited liability company, as the general partner of the Fund and the Master Partnership (the “**General Partner**”), and each of the Persons listed in the books and records of the Fund as Limited Partners of the Fund from time to time. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings set forth in the immediately preceding page labelled “**Deal Terms**” or in **Exhibit A**.

In consideration of the mutual promises and agreements herein made and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

1. ### formation, creation of series and classes, name and purpose
   1. #### Formation; Creation of Series and Classes
      1. The Master Partnership was formed as a series limited partnership effective on the date on which the certificate of limited partnership of the Master Partnership was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the Act.
       1. Pursuant to Section 17-218(b) of the Act and the Master Partnership Agreement, the Master Partnership is authorized and empowered to establish separate series of general and limited partners, and general and limited partner interests, with separate and distinct rights, powers, duties and obligations (each a “**Series**"), and each Series is authorized to have a separate business purpose and objective. Each Series shall be considered a separate and distinct “protected series” for purposes of Section 17-218 of the Act and a separate and distinct “series” for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The General Partner has established the Fund as a Series of the Master Partnership pursuant to the provisions of the Act, the Master Partnership Agreement and this Agreement. The Fund and the rights and obligations of the Partners of the Fund admitted hereunder shall be governed by this Agreement. In the event of any inconsistency between this Agreement and the Master Partnership Agreement, this Agreement shall prevail. The debts, liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing with respect to the Fund shall be enforceable only against the assets of the Fund or the General Partner and not against the assets of the Master Partnership generally, any other Series thereof, or any general partner not associated with the Fund, and, unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, none of the debts, liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing with respect to the Master Partnership generally or any other Series thereof shall be enforceable against the assets of the Fund or the General Partner of the Fund. A Partner admitted to one Series shall have no rights or interest with respect to any other Series, except to the extent such Partner acquires an interest in such other Series. This Agreement and all provisions herein shall be interpreted in a manner to give full effect to the separateness of each Series.
        1. Pursuant to the Act, the Fund as a Series is authorized to establish separate classes of limited partner interests (each, a "**Class**"), each with certain distinct rights, powers, duties, obligations as prescribed by this Agreement.  By executing a Subscription Agreement, a Limited Partner of a Class of Interests agrees to:
            - all provisions with general application to Limited Partners of all Classes and, 
            - any provisions applied specifically to Limited Partners of the Class into which the executing Limited Partner is seeking admission.  
         1. Each Limited Partner further acknowledges and agrees that: 
            - provisions, rights and conditions specific to a Class of the Fund shall not apply to Limited Partners of other Classes; and 
            -  Fund assets attributable to all Classes, if any, may in some circumstances be used to satisfy Fund liabilities owed to third parties.      
   1. #### [clause="name-purpose"] Name; Purpose
      1. The name of the Fund shall be “{{carta.fund_name}}”, subject to change by the General Partner in accordance with the Act upon notice to the Limited Partners. 
      1. The primary purpose of the Fund is to seek income and gain through the acquisition, holding, and distribution or other disposition of the Target Securities of the Target Company and any Portfolio Assets received in exchange for or otherwise with respect to the Target Securities. The Fund may also engage in any other lawful activities determined by the General Partner to be necessary, advisable or desirable, carry out or in furtherance of the foregoing activities.  Each Limited Partner acknowledges and agrees that: 
         - the General Partner and the Investment Adviser may not verify or review and does not endorse, adopt or guarantee information provided by the Target Company or the Lead Partner on the Platform; 
         - the General Partner and the Investment Adviser shall not have any responsibility for the accuracy or veracity of any information provided by the Target Company or the Lead Partner on the Platform; and 
         - the General Partner and the Investment Adviser do not propose to evaluate the potential profitability, or lack thereof, of an investment in the Target Company or the Target Securities.
   1. #### [clause="qualifications"] Qualifications
      1. The General Partner shall cause the Fund to be qualified or registered under assumed or fictitious names or foreign limited partnership statutes or similar laws in any jurisdiction in which the Fund transacts business and to the extent, in the judgment of the General Partner, such qualification or registration is necessary or advisable in order to protect the limited liability of the Limited Partners or to permit the Fund lawfully to own property or transact business.
      1. The General Partner shall have the power and authority to execute, file and publish all such certificates, notices, statements or other instruments necessary to permit the Fund to conduct business as a series of a limited partnership with the classes contemplated hereunder in all jurisdictions where the Fund elects to do business. 
 
1. ###  capitalization
   1. #### [clause="capital-admission"] Capital Commitments; Admission of Partners
      1. **Capital Commitments**. Each Limited Partner, upon admission to the Fund, shall be deemed to have made an aggregate capital commitment equal to such Limited Partner’s Total Capital Commitment.  The Investment Commitment of the Lead Partner shall be equal to at least the Minimum Lead Partner Commitment, which shall be paid in cash (the “**Lead Partner Commitment**”), then on or shortly prior to the date of the Initial Closing, the Lead Partner or an Affiliate thereof shall either make capital contributions to the Fund or purchase Target Securities from the Target Company in an amount equal to no less than the amount indicated on the Platform. Unless otherwise approved by the General Partner in its discretion, each Limited Partner’s Investment Commitment shall equal at least Minimum Investor Commitment.
      1. [clause="capital-admission-b"] **Admission of Partners**. The General Partner may hold an “**Initial Closing**” of the Fund and commence admitting Class A Limited Partners or Class B Limited Partners upon its acceptance and approval of: 
         - aggregate Investment Commitments of at least the Initial Closing Amount and, 
         - Subscription Agreements from Class A Limited Partners or Class B Limited Partners. Thereafter, the General Partner may admit additional Limited Partners as Class A Limited Partners or Class B Limited Partners, as applicable, or accept increases in the Investment Commitments of existing Partners, on the same terms as applied at the Initial Closing (subject to **clause [ref-clause="capital-contibutions-b"]** and **clause [ref-clause="profit-and-loss-b"]** ; provided that this clause shall not limit the ability of the Fund or the General Partner to enter into side letters or similar agreements in accordance with **clause [ref-clause="entire-agreement"]**), at one or more additional closings held not later than the close of business on the date that is equal to Closing Days after the date of the Initial Closing; provided that, unless the Committed Capital is “N/A”, in no event shall the aggregate Investment Commitments of all the Partners exceed the Committed Capital, inclusive of the Lead Partner Commitment. 
        1. Subject to the express provisions of this Agreement, the General Partner’s determination to admit any specific Person as a Limited Partner (or to deny such admission) shall be at the General Partner’s discretion. Any such additional Limited Partner shall be deemed admitted to the Fund as a Class A Limited Partner or Class B Limited Partner, as applicable, upon acceptance and approval of its Subscription Agreement by the General Partner.
   1. #### [clause="capital-contibutions"] Capital Contributions
      1. [clause="capital-contibutions-a"] **General**. Except to the extent provided in **clause [ref-clause="limitation-liability"]** and **[ref-clause="distributions-subject-return"]**, all capital contributions shall be in cash. Each Partner shall contribute one hundred percent (100%) of its Total Capital Commitment upon its admittance to the Fund. The obligation of a Partner to satisfy its Total Capital Commitment and any other obligations to contribute capital hereunder shall be without interest (other than in the case of default as provided in **clause [ref-clause="failure-to-make-cap-contribution"]**). If the Lead Partner Commitment increases after the Initial Closing, the Lead Partner shall, within 10 business days after such increase, make a capital contribution to cause the Lead Partner’s total capital contributions to be at least equal to the capital contributions that would have been required if its Lead Partner Commitment had at all times following the Initial Closing been equal to its Lead Partner Commitment as determined immediately after such increase.
      1. [clause="capital-contibutions-b"] **Late Admissions; Increases in Investment Commitments**. In the event an additional Limited Partner is admitted to the Fund after the Initial Closing, such additional Limited Partner shall, at the time of its admission to the Fund, make an initial capital contribution equal to such additional Limited Partner’s Total Capital Commitment. In the case of an existing Limited Partner that, pursuant to **clause [ref-clause="capital-admission-b"]**, increases its Investment Commitment after the Initial Closing, such Limited Partner shall be subject to the provisions of this clause with respect to the amount of such increase as if newly admitted to the Fund as an additional Limited Partner.
      1. **Additional Capital Contributions**. Except as specifically provided in this Agreement, no Person shall be permitted or required to make a contribution to the capital of the Fund or the Master Partnership.
   1. #### [clause="additional-investments"] Additional Investments in the Target Company
      1. If the Fund has Follow-On Rights and if the opportunity to make an additional investment in the securities of the Target Company is offered to the General Partner or its Affiliates, the General Partner shall, subject to legal, tax or other regulatory requirements, offer each Limited Partner the right to participate in such follow-on investment (a “Follow-On Investment”) pro rata in the proportion that such Limited Partner’s Investment Commitment bears to the aggregate Investment Commitments of all Limited Partners. The General Partner shall provide the Limited Partners notice of any such Follow-On Investment opportunity as far in advance of the anticipated closing date for such Follow-On Investment as is commercially reasonably practicable under the circumstances, along with such other information related to such Follow-On Investment that the Limited Partners may reasonably request that may be in the possession of the General Partner (which information may be made available through the Platform). 
      1. Each Limited Partner shall have at least 10 days from receipt of such notice to elect, by written notice to the General Partner, to participate in such Follow-On Investment opportunity and to execute the appropriate documents (including electronic materials made available through the Platform) evidencing such Limited Partner’s participation in such Follow-On Investment opportunity. Any portion of such Follow-On Investment opportunity that is made available to such Limited Partner but which is not acquired by such Limited Partner shall be made available to each participating Limited Partner in the proportion that such participating Limited Partner’s Investment Commitment bears to the aggregate Investment Commitments of all participating Limited Partners.
      1. Any portion of such additional Follow-On Investment opportunity that is made available to such participating Limited Partners but which is not acquired by any participating Limited Partners may be made available to other funds or vehicles managed by the General Partner, the Investment Adviser or any of their respective Affiliates or to unaffiliated third parties. The Partners anticipate that any Follow-On Investment will be made through a separate Series, limited liability company, limited partnership or other entity organized by the General Partner or its Affiliate for the purpose of making such Follow-On Investment.
   1. #### [clause="failure-to-make-cap-contribution"] Failure to Make Capital Contributions 
      1. If a Limited Partner fails to make all or any portion of a capital contribution when due or fails to return a distribution pursuant to **clause [ref-clause="distributions-subject-return"]** and such failure continues uncured for a period of 5 business days, then the General Partner will provide written notice of such failure to such Limited Partner. If such Limited Partner fails to cure such non-payment within 5 business days following delivery of such further notice, the General Partner may, in its discretion, take either or both of the following actions: 
         - declare the Limited Partner a **“Defaulting Limited Partner”**; and/or
         - pursue all available remedies at law or in equity against such Limited Partner, all of which shall be cumulative to the maximum extent permitted by law, including requiring that the Limited Partner promptly pay to the Fund:
            - interest on the due and uncontributed amount at an annual rate equal to 18%, compounded daily; and 
            -  all amounts necessary to reimburse the Fund for its costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, incurred by the Fund in connection with the Fund’s collection efforts in respect of the due and uncontributed amount (which interest and expense reimbursement shall be treated as income or expense reimbursement of the Fund and not as a capital contribution by the Defaulting Limited Partner). The General Partner may also deduct any amounts due from the Defaulting Limited Partner from future distributions otherwise payable to the Defaulting Limited Partner, and the General Partner may deem the Defaulting Limited Partner to have withdrawn from the Fund effective as of the close of business on the date upon which the capital contribution in question was originally due and the Defaulting Limited Partner’s Capital Account balance shall be forfeited and shall be reallocated to the Capital Accounts of the other Partners in proportion to their aggregate capital contributions.
   1. #### [clause="limitation-liability"] Limitation of Liability 
      1. Except as otherwise required by applicable law no Limited Partner in its capacity as such shall be personally liable in any manner whatsoever for any debt, liability, or other obligation of the Fund; and 
      1.	No Limited Partner in its capacity as such shall have any liability in respect of the obligations of the Fund in excess of the following (without duplication), solely by reason of being a Limited Partner of the Fund: 
         - its unpaid Total Capital Commitment; 
         - its share of any assets and undistributed Profits and assets of the Fund; and 
         - its obligation to make other payments or return distributions expressly provided for in this Agreement, including, without limitation, the Administration Fee, and this **clause [ref-clause="limitation-liability"]** shall be deemed to limit a Limited Partner’s liability to the Fund or to another Limited Partner in respect of any breach by such Partner of any provision of this Agreement or such Limited Partner’s Subscription Agreement.

1. ### profits and losses
   1. #### [clause="fund-profit-and-loss"] Fund Profit and Loss
      1. [clause="profit-and-loss-a"] **Allocation of Fund Profits and Loss**. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Profits, Losses and, to the extent necessary, individual items of income, gain, loss or deduction of the Fund for each fiscal year or other applicable period will be allocated among the Partners in a manner such that the adjusted Capital Account of each such Partner, immediately after making such allocation and after taking into account amounts specially allocated pursuant to this Section, shall be equal to the excess (which may be negative) of:
         - The amount that would be distributed to such Partner if, 
            - the Fund were terminated, its affairs wound up, its assets sold for cash equal to their Book Values at the end of such fiscal year or other applicable period, and 
				-  all Fund liabilities were satisfied in cash according to their terms (limited, with respect to each nonrecourse liability, to the Book Value of the assets securing such liability), and 
				-  the net proceeds thereof (after satisfaction of such liabilities) were distributed pursuant to **clause [ref-clause="discretionary-distributions"]**, over
         - The sum of the amount, if any, which such Partner would be obligated to contribute to the capital of the Fund, 
            - such Partner’s share of minimum gain (as determined according to Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(g)), and 
				-  such Partner’s share of partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain (as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(2)), all as determined immediately prior to the hypothetical sale described in this clause;
            provided, however, that the General Partner may adjust the allocations that are determined (without regard to this proviso) pursuant to this **clause [ref-clause="fund-profit-and-loss"]** if the General Partner determines reasonably and in good faith that such adjustment is required to comply with the requirements of Section 704(b) of the Internal Revenue Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, or to give economic effect to all other relevant provisions of this Agreement.
      1. [clause="profit-and-loss-b"] **Special Allocations Attributable to Multiple Closings**. If additional Limited Partners are admitted to the Fund (or existing Partners increase their Investment Commitments) at a closing after the Initial Closing, allocations of Profit and Loss attributable to periods subsequent to such closing shall be adjusted by the General Partner as necessary to, as quickly as possible, cause the Capital Account balances of the Partners to reflect the same amounts that they would have reflected if all Partners had been admitted to the Fund and made all of their Investment Commitments at the Initial Closing, had made capital contributions in respect of such Total Capital Commitment, and its other payment obligations as and when due in accordance with **clause [ref-clause="capital-contibutions"]**, and had received allocations of Profit and Loss in accordance with the provisions of this **clause [ref-clause="fund-profit-and-loss"]**. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to override the application to a Defaulting Limited Partner of **clause [ref-clause="failure-to-make-cap-contribution"]** or to increase a Partner’s Capital Account balance by the amount of a capital contribution not actually made.
      1. **Adjustment to Capital Accounts for Distributions of Property**. If property distributed in kind is reflected in the Capital Accounts of the Partners at a book value (i.e., the property’s basis for purposes of determining Profit and Loss with respect thereto as determined in accordance with the principles set forth in the definition of Profits and Losses in Exhibit A) that differs from the Fair Market Value of the property at the time of distribution, the difference shall be treated as Profit or Loss on the sale of the property and shall be allocated among the Partners, as of the time immediately prior to such distribution, in accordance with the provisions of this **clause [ref-clause="fund-profit-and-loss"]**.
      1. **Allocations in Event of Transfer**. If an interest in the Fund is Transferred in accordance with this Agreement, allocations of Profits and Losses as between the transferor and transferee shall be made using any method selected by the General Partner and permitted under applicable law.
      1. **Regulatory Allocations**. The safe harbor provisions and other rules of the Treasury Regulations under Section 704(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, including Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b), relating to qualified income offset, minimum gain chargeback, minimum gain chargeback with respect to Partner nonrecourse debt, allocations of nonrecourse deductions, allocations with respect to Partner nonrecourse debt, limitations on allocations of losses to cause or increase a Capital Account deficit, and forfeiture allocations with respect to substantially nonvested partnership interests (the “Regulatory Allocations”) are hereby incorporated by reference and shall be applied, as determined by the General Partner to the allocation of income, gain, loss, or deduction in the manner provided in the Treasury Regulations. In the event the Regulatory Allocations result in allocations being made that are inconsistent with the manner in which the Partners intend to divide the Fund’s Profits and Losses as reflected in **clause [ref-clause="fund-profit-and-loss"]**, the General Partner may, in its discretion, adjust subsequent allocations of any items of gain, loss, income, deduction, or expense such that the net amount of the Regulatory Allocations and such subsequent special adjustments to each Partner is zero.
      1. **Tax Allocations**. Except as otherwise provided in this **clause [ref-clause="fund-profit-and-loss"]** or as otherwise required by the Internal Revenue Code and the rules and Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, a Partner’s distributive share of the Fund's income, gain, loss, deduction, or expense for income tax purposes shall be the same as is entered in the Partner’s Capital Account pursuant to this Agreement. In accordance with Section 704(c) of the Internal Revenue Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, and by such methods determined by the General Partner, allocations of items of income, gain, loss, deduction, or expense for income tax purposes shall be allocated among the Partners so as to take into account any variation between the adjusted tax basis of Fund property and the Book Value of such property as determined for purposes of maintaining Capital Accounts.
   1. #### Modifications to Preserve Underlying Economic Objectives
      In the event of a change in applicable tax law, the General Partner, acting in its reasonable discretion after consultation with tax counsel to the Fund, shall make the minimum modifications to the allocation, distribution or other provisions of this Agreement necessary or appropriate to preserve the underlying economic objectives of the Partners as reflected in this Agreement.
   1. #### [clause="special-taxes"] Withholding/Special Taxes
      1. [clause="special-taxes-a"] **General**. The Fund shall withhold taxes and other amounts from distributions to, and allocations among, the Partners to the extent required by applicable law (as determined by the General Partner in its reasonable discretion). Except as otherwise provided in this **clause [ref-clause="special-taxes"]**, any amount so withheld by the Fund with regard to a Partner shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as an amount actually distributed to such Partner pursuant to **clause [ref-clause="discretionary-distributions"]** and shall correspondingly reduce distributions to which such Partner is otherwise entitled pursuant to **clause [ref-clause="discretionary-distributions"]**. An amount shall be considered withheld by the Fund if, and at the time, remitted to or at the direction of a governmental agency without regard to whether such remittance occurs at the same time as the distribution or allocation to which it relates; provided, however, that an amount actually withheld from a specific distribution or designated by the General Partner as withheld from a specific allocation shall be treated as if distributed at the time such distribution or allocation occurs. Each Limited Partner shall take such actions as are required to establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the General Partner that: 
         - the Partner is not subject to withholding tax obligations imposed by any FATCA rule and 
         - does not subject the Fund to any withholding tax obligations imposed by any FATCA rule.
      1. **Negative Capital Account**. To the extent that operation of **clause [ref-clause="special-taxes-a"]** would create a negative balance in the Updated Capital Account of a Limited Partner or increase the amount by which such Updated Capital Account balance is negative, the amount of the deemed distribution shall instead be treated as a loan by the Fund to such Limited Partner, which loan shall be payable upon demand by the General Partner and shall bear interest at a floating rate equal to the prime rate of the Fund’s bank, compounded daily.
      1. [clause="special-taxes-loans"] **Loan**. If the General Partner determines in its discretion that the Fund lacks sufficient cash available to pay withholding taxes in respect of a Partner, the General Partner may, in its discretion (and notwithstanding the provisions of **clause [ref-clause="authority-gp"]**), make a loan or capital contribution to the Fund to enable the Fund to pay such taxes. Any such loan shall be full-recourse to the Fund and shall bear interest at a floating rate equal to two percentage points above the prime rate of the Fund’s bank, compounded daily. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any loan (including interest accrued thereon) or capital contribution made to the Fund by the General Partner pursuant to this **clause [ref-clause="special-taxes-loans"]** shall be repaid or returned as promptly as is reasonably possible.
      1. **Reimbursement**. Except as otherwise agreed to in writing with the General Partner, each Limited Partner shall reimburse the Fund and the General Partner for any liability they may incur for failure to properly withhold taxes in respect of such Limited Partner; provided, however, that no such reimbursement obligation shall apply with respect to interest, penalties, or similar additions to tax to the extent that such interest, penalties, or additions are attributable to Material Misconduct by the General Partner or the Fund. Each Limited Partner hereby agrees that neither the Fund nor the General Partner shall be liable for any excess taxes withheld in respect of such Limited Partner’s interest in the Fund and that, in the event of overwithholding, a Limited Partner’s sole recourse shall be to apply for a refund from the appropriate governmental authority.
      1. [clause="third-party-withholding"] **Treatment of Third-Party Withholding**. Notwithstanding **clause [ref-clause="expenses-a"]**, taxes withheld by third parties from payments to the Fund shall be treated as if withheld by the Fund for purposes of this **clause [ref-clause="special-taxes"]**; provided that any taxes so determined and withheld by third parties generally and without regard for the tax status of the Partners of the Fund shall not be deemed to have been distributed to the Partners. As reasonably determined by the General Partner, if any tax is withheld from payments to the Fund exclusively in respect of one or more Limited Partners (whether in consequence of a breach of **clause [ref-clause="special-taxes-a"]**  or any other provision of this Agreement by one or more Limited Partners or otherwise), such withholding shall be deemed to have been made exclusively in respect of such Limited Partners. If the Fund receives a refund of taxes previously withheld by a third party from one or more payments to the Fund, the economic benefit of such refund shall be apportioned among the Partners in a manner reasonably determined by the General Partner to offset the prior operation of this **clause [ref-clause="third-party-withholding"]** in respect of such withheld taxes, if applicable. This **clause [ref-clause="third-party-withholding"]** shall be applied so as not to give rise to duplicative reductions in the Partners’ Capital Account balances in cases where taxes withheld by third parties would otherwise give rise to an allocation of Loss under **clause [ref-clause="fund-profit-and-loss"]**.
      1. **In-Kind Distributions**. If the Fund is required to remit cash to a governmental agency in respect of a withholding obligation arising from an in-kind distribution by the Fund or the Fund’s receipt of an in-kind payment, the General Partner may cause the Fund to sell an appropriate portion of the property at issue and, to the extent permitted by applicable law (as determined by the General Partner in its reasonable discretion), any resulting income or gain shall be allocated solely for income tax purposes entirely to the Partner or Partners in respect of which such withholding obligation arises (in such proportion as the General Partner shall determine in its reasonable discretion).

1. ### distributions	
   1. #### [clause="discretionary-distributions"] Discretionary distributions
      1. Subject to maintaining necessary reserves as determined by the General Partner in its discretion, prior to winding-up and liquidation of the Fund, the General Partner may cause the Fund to distribute cash or property of the Fund to the Partners, at such times and in such amounts, as it shall determine in its discretion; provided, however, that the General Partner shall use reasonable efforts to promptly distribute excess cash arising from the disposition of Portfolio Assets and any Marketable Securities held by the Fund within Distribution Days. 
      1. Items of cash or property comprising distributions pursuant to this **clause [ref-clause="discretionary-distributions"]** shall be apportioned, on a preliminary basis, among the Partners in proportion to their respective aggregate capital contributions. Items attributable to Short-Term Investments, as well as items apportioned to the General Partner pursuant to its aggregate capital contributions, shall be distributed in accordance with their respective aggregate capital contributions. 
      1. [clause="discretionary-distributions-c"] On a separate basis for each Limited Partner, all remaining items apportioned to such Limited Partner pursuant to its aggregate capital contributions shall be reapportioned between and distributed to such Limited Partner, on the one hand, and the General Partner, on the other hand, as follows:
      
       {% if carta.spv_constitution_carried_interest > 0 %}
         - first, 100% to each of the Limited Partners pro rata to their respective Capital Contributions until all Limited Partners have received aggregate distribution for all periods equal to the aggregate amount of Capital Contributions made by such Member for all periods
          {% if carta.spv_constitution_preferred_return and carta.spv_constitution_preferred_return != 'No preferred return' %}
         - second, 100% to each of the Limited Partners pro rata to their respective Capital Contributions until all Limited Partners have{% if carta.spv_constitution_preferred_return == 'Annual IRR (e.g. until investors have been returned an IRR of 8%)' %} achieved, on the date of that distribution, an IRR of {{carta.spv_constitution_preferred_return_value}}% on the applicable portion of their respective Capital Contributions;{% elif carta.spv_constitution_preferred_return == 'Multiple of investment (e.g. until investors have been returned 2x their initial investment)'  %}received an amount equal to {{carta.spv_constitution_preferred_return_multiple}}% the applicable portion of their respective Capital Contributions;{% endif %}

        
         {% if carta.spv_constitution_catchup and carta.spv_constitution_catchup == 'Catchup acceleration for the Lead Partner' %}
         - third, {{carta.spv_constitution_catchup_allocation}}% to the {{ founders }}{% if carta.spv_constitution_catchup_allocation < 100 %} and {{100-carta.spv_constitution_catchup_allocation}}% to the Limited Partners (respective to their Capital Contributions) {% endif %}, until such time as the {{ founders }} shall have received (without duplication and in aggregate) a sum equal to {{carta.spv_constitution_carried_interest}}% of the aggregate of (i) distributions to Limited Partners pursuant to paragraph (b) above and (ii) distributions to the {{ founders }} pursuant to this paragraph (c);
        {% endif %}
        {% endif %}

         - thereafter, the balance shall be allocated as to {{ 100-carta.spv_constitution_carried_interest}}% to the Limited Partners (pro rata to their respective Capital Contributions) and as to {{carta.spv_constitution_carried_interest}}% to the {{founders}}.

    {% else %}

    {% endif %}
         It is expressly understood that reapportionments and distributions pursuant to **clause [ref-clause="discretionary-distributions-c"]** shall be made solely in respect of each Limited Partner on a separate basis, and without reference to any items apportioned and distributed to any other Partner (including the General Partner) in connection with (A) the aggregate capital contributions or (B) the separate operation of **clause [ref-clause="discretionary-distributions-c"]** in respect of any other Partner.
      1. Each Partner actually receiving amounts pursuant to a specific distribution by the Fund shall receive a ratable portion in all material respects of each item of cash or property comprising such distribution; provided, however, that the General Partner may vary the apportionment among the Partners of an in-kind distribution as necessary to avoid the distribution of fractional interests in Securities.
      1. All Carried Interest Distributions shall be apportioned and distributed among the Carried Interest Recipients in such manner and in such amounts as may be mutually agreed by the Carried Interest Recipients from time to time.  
      1. Subject to **clause [ref-clause="general-provisions-transfers"]** , the General Partner may, in its sole discretion, allow the Special Partner to assign to one or more Persons all or any portion of its respective interest in the Fund, including its right to receive any Carried Interest Distributions made to it under **clause [ref-clause="discretionary-distributions-c"]** and any distributions pursuant to **clause [ref-clause="tax-distributions"]** in respect thereof.  
   1. #### [clause="tax-distributions"] Tax Distributions
      Subject to maintaining necessary reserves as determined by the General Partner in its discretion, at any time after the end of each calendar year during the Term, the Fund may distribute to each Partner in cash an amount equal to the excess, if any of (a) the product of the Applicable Tax Rate and the net Profits allocated to such Partner for such calendar year, over (b) all prior cash distributions to such Partner made pursuant to **clause [ref-clause="discretionary-distributions"]** or this **clause [ref-clause="tax-distributions"]** during such calendar year (other than amounts made pursuant to this **clause [ref-clause="tax-distributions"]** during such calendar year with respect to a prior calendar year). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner shall have the authority, in its discretion, to make good faith estimates of amounts expected to be distributable pursuant to this **clause [ref-clause="tax-distributions"]** with respect to a given calendar year and to distribute such estimated amounts to the Partners as advances from time to time during such calendar year. The “**Applicable Tax Rate**” shall mean the combination of the highest state, local and federal, self-employment and Medicare tax rates payable by individuals who are residents in Delaware, applied by taking into account the character of the taxable income in question (e.g., long-term capital gains, ordinary income, etc.), as determined by the General Partner. Distributions made pursuant to this **clause [ref-clause="tax-distributions"]** shall be deemed advances under, and shall reduce the distributions to be made under, the relevant provisions of **clause [ref-clause="discretionary-distributions"]**.
   1. #### [clause="withdrawals-and-return"] Withdrawals and Return of Capital
      Except as specifically provided in this Agreement or with the consent of the General Partner, no Partner shall: 
         -  withdraw any portion of its capital contributions or Capital Account balance; 
         -  be entitled to any return on or of such Partner’s capital contribution, Capital Account balance of undistributed Profits, or specific assets of the Fund; or 
         -  be entitled to interest on such Partner’s capital contributions, Capital Account balance, or share of unallocated Profits.
   1. #### [clause="liquidating-distributions"] Liquidating Distribution
      Notwithstanding the provisions of **clause [ref-clause="discretionary-distributions"]**, cash or property of the Fund available for distribution upon the winding-up and liquidation of the Fund (including cash or property received upon the sale or other disposition of assets in anticipation of or in connection with such winding-up and liquidation) shall be distributed in accordance with the provisions of **clause [ref-clause="winding-up-liquidation"]** .
   1. #### [clause="limitation-on-distributions"] Limitations on Distribution
      Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no distribution shall be made to a Partner pursuant to this Agreement if and to the extent that such distribution would violate the Act or other applicable law. Notwithstanding any other provision of this **clause [ref-clause="limitation-on-distributions"]**, prior to the winding-up and liquidation of the Fund, the Fund shall not, without the prior approval of a Majority-in-Interest of the Limited Partners make a distribution of non-Marketable Securities. There shall be no distribution to a Partner if and to the extent that such distribution would create a negative balance in the Updated Capital Account of such Partner or increase the amount by which such Updated Capital Account balance is negative. Distributions pursuant to this Agreement shall be subject to such conditions and restrictions as shall be determined by the General Partner to be required or appropriate under applicable law or other obligations to which the Fund may be subject. In the event residual cash of the Fund is a de minimis amount, the General Partner may, in its discretion, retain the cash or cause the Fund to donate such amount for charitable purposes.
   1. #### [clause="distributions-subject-return"] Distributions Subject to return
      1. In the event the Fund is required to return all or some portion of cash or Securities as a result of an indemnification, purchase price adjustment or similar obligation on the part of the Fund arising out of a sale or exchange of Securities, or
         -  the Fund has a withholding or other tax liability in connection with such sale or exchange or a distribution of in-kind Securities, or 
         -  the Fund has an obligation to a Protected Person pursuant to **clause [ref-clause="indemnification"]**, the General Partner may, in its discretion, require that the Partners return to the Fund, upon not less than 10 days’ notice from the General Partner, all or any portion of the distributions made to the Partners (in proportion to their respective shares of the distributions at issue and including any distribution made to the General Partner under **clause [ref-clause="discretionary-distributions-c"](a)**); provided, however, that 
            -  no Partner shall be required to return to the Fund pursuant to this **clause [ref-clause="distributions-subject-return"]** an aggregate amount that exceeds the aggregate amount of distributions received by such Partner from the Fund, and
            -  that no Partner shall be required to return any distribution after the second anniversary of the final liquidating distribution of the Fund except to fund any return obligation with respect to which the General Partner has, in its reasonable judgment, provided notice of a pending or potential claim prior to such second anniversary. 
        1. The Partners’ obligation pursuant to this **clause [ref-clause="distributions-subject-return"]** shall survive the winding-up and liquidation of the Fund. Amounts returned by a Partner pursuant to this **clause [ref-clause="distributions-subject-return"]** shall be treated as a reduction in the amount of distributions received by such Partner and not a capital contribution and shall increase such Partner’s Capital Account. With respect to the return of a distribution that was made in-kind, each Limited Partner may, at its option, return either identical property or cash equal to the Fair Market Value of such property at the time of distribution. The provisions of this **clause [ref-clause="distributions-subject-return"]** shall not be construed or interpreted as inuring to the benefit of any creditor of the Fund, the Master Partnership, any other Series or any Partner.

         -  Hire consultants, financial advisors, appraisers, attorneys, accountants, investment bankers, underwriters, appraisers, administrators, placement agents and such other agents for the Fund as it may deem necessary or advisable, and authorize any such agent to act for and on behalf of the Fund;

The General Partner is hereby authorized to enter into the documents described in the preceding sentence on behalf of the Fund, but such authorization shall not be deemed a restriction on the power of the General Partner to enter into other documents on behalf of the Partnership.
      1. To the extent permitted by the Act, the General Partner may, in its discretion, delegate to any Person (including the Investment Adviser or the Administrator) any of the management or administrative responsibilities of the General Partner under this Agreement (including but not limited to, identifying, evaluating and approving the Fund’s investments and its dispositions thereof) and may assign to any such Person the right to receive all or any portion of the fees or reimbursements otherwise payable to the General Partner under this Agreement.

To the maximum extent permitted by law, including Section 17-1101(d) of the Act, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or in any agreement contemplated herein or applicable provisions of law or equity or otherwise, the General Partner shall not owe any duty (including any fiduciary duty) to the Fund or to any Limited Partner; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not eliminate the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing under the Act or any non-waivable duties under the Investment Advisers Act. The provisions of this Agreement, to the extent that they restrict or eliminate the duties and liabilities of the General Partner otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the Limited Partners to replace fully and completely such other duties and liabilities.
      1. [clause="18-1"] Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any contract, agreement, deed, lease, note or other document or instrument executed on behalf of the Fund by the General Partner shall be deemed to have been duly executed by the Fund; no other Partner’s signature shall be required in connection with the foregoing and third parties shall be entitled to rely upon the General Partner’s power to bind the Fund without otherwise ascertaining that the requirements of this Agreement have been satisfied.

Terms in quotations used in this **clause [ref-clause="management-lp"]** have the meanings ascribed to them under FIRRMA.
      1.

   1. #### [clause="expenses"] Expenses

      1. **Sharing of Expenses**. Expenses that are paid or incurred for the benefit of the Fund as well as one or more investment vehicles (including any other Series) or accounts managed by the General Partner or its Affiliates shall be allocated among the Fund and such investment vehicles (including any other Series) or accounts in the General Partner’s discretion

      The General Partner shall value the Fund’s assets and liabilities whenever required by this Agreement or determined by the General Partner in its discretion. Any such value shall be the “Fair Market Value” and shall be binding and conclusive for all purposes of this Agreement. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, in determining the value of the Fund’s assets or liabilities or a Partner’s interest in the Fund, no value shall be placed on the Fund’s goodwill, name and mark, records, files or statistical data or on similar assets not normally reflected in the Fund’s accounting records. The following criteria shall be used for determining the Fair Market Value of Securities: 
         - if traded on one or more U.S. or non-U.S. securities exchanges, the Fair Market Value shall be deemed to be the Security’s average closing price for the five trading days prior to the valuation date on the principal security exchange for such Security; 
         - if actively traded over-the-counter but not on a U.S. or non-U.S. securities exchange, the Fair Market Value shall be deemed to be the average of the mean of the last bid and ask prices for the five trading days prior to the valuation date; and  
         - if there is no active public market, the General Partner shall make a determination of the Fair Market Value on the valuation date, taking into consideration such factors determined by the General Partner as relevant, including current financial position and current and historical operating results of the issuer, sales prices of recent transactions in the same or similar securities, restrictions on transfer, and significant recent events affecting the issuer.
         Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the General Partner in good faith determines that, because of special circumstances, the valuation methods set forth in this clause do not fairly determine the value of a Security, the General Partner shall make such adjustments or use such alternative valuation method as it deems appropriate.		
   1. #### [clause="confidentially"] Confidentially
      1. [clause="confidentially-a"] Each Limited Partner shall treat Confidential Information that such Limited Partner may receive or that may be disclosed, distributed or disseminated (whether in writing, orally or by other means) to such Limited Partner or its representatives or otherwise as a result of such Limited Partner’s interest in the Fund, as strictly confidential, and Confidential Information shall not, without the prior consent of the General Partner, be disclosed to any Person or used by such Limited Partner other than for a Fund purpose.

         -  on a reasonable need to know basis to its directors, managers, general partners, managing members, trustees, officers, employees, representatives, agents, advisors or its equity holders for their use in furtherance of their interests as equity holders of such Limited Partner, so long in each case such Persons are bound by duties of confidentiality to such Limited Partner and such Limited Partner shall remain liable for any breach of this clause by such Persons; 
         -  required to be disclosed pursuant to applicable law (but only to the extent of such requirement, after consultation with the General Partner unless prohibited and only to the extent that such requirement cannot be avoided or eliminated via commercially reasonable efforts on the part of such Limited Partner); or
         -  required to be disclosed or used in order to enforce such Limited Partner’s rights under this Agreement (but only to the extent of such requirement and only after consultation with the General Partner).
        1. Each Limited Partner shall promptly notify the General Partner of any unauthorized release or use of any Confidential Information. “**Confidential Information**” shall mean this Agreement (and all provisions of this Agreement), the Master Partnership Agreement and any other Separate Series Partnership Agreement, and all other documents and information concerning the affairs of the Fund, its Affiliates, Partners and issuers of Portfolio Assets and other investments, the Master Partnership and any other series thereof, and any of their Affiliates, partners and issuers of investments, including all financial statements, tax reports, valuations, reports, reviews, analyses or other materials; provided, however, with respect to a Limited Partner, Confidential Information shall not include: 
            - information that is or has been independently developed or obtained by such Limited Partner without use of Confidential Information, or pursuant to this Agreement or an authorization provided by the General Partner, or to the extent that such information was received from a third party not subject to confidentiality limitations and such Limited Partner can establish that it rightfully received such information from such party other than as a result of the breach of this clause by such Limited Partner or such party; or
            - to the extent that the information provided by the Fund is otherwise publicly available in the absence of any improper or unlawful action on the part of such Limited Partner. The Partners’ obligation under this **clause [ref-clause="confidentially"]** shall survive the winding-up and liquidation of the Fund. 
      1. **Right to Withhold Confidential Information**. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the General Partner may withhold disclosure of any Confidential Information (other than this Agreement or tax reports) to any particular Limited Partner if the General Partner reasonably determines that 
         - such Limited Partner may not adequately protect against the disclosure of Confidential Information, 
         - such disclosure is not in the best interests of the Fund or any issuer of Portfolio Assets, or 
         - such Limited Partner would have access to “material non-public technical information” (as such term is defined under FIRRMA). 
      1. **Exception for Certain Legal Requirements**. Nothing in this Agreement (including **clause [ref-clause="confidentially-a"]**) prohibits: 
         -  disclosure of the Federal tax treatment and tax structure of the Fund or any transactions contemplated by this Agreement to comply with Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b)(3), or
         - reporting possible violations of Federal law or state law or regulations to any governmental agency or entity or bona fide self-regulatory organization, or making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of applicable law or regulation, in each case without any notice to or authorization from the General Partner.

      Each Partner shall furnish to the Fund upon request any information or related documentation with respect to such Partner reasonably determined by the General Partner to be necessary or appropriate in connection with the formation, operation, termination, winding-up, or liquidation of the Fund.

Without limitation on the preceding sentence, as requested by the General Partner, each Partner shall furnish such information and related documentation (including duly executed governmental forms) regarding such Partner and the ultimate beneficial ownership and management of such Partner as is reasonably necessary or appropriate for the General Partner, the Investment Adviser, the Fund, the Target Company and their respective Affiliates to comply with applicable governmental reporting requirements and FATCA rules as well as “know your customer,” “anti-money laundering” and similar rules.

[clause="fund-representative-audits-a"] The General Partner shall be the “partnership representative” of the Fund (“**Partnership Representative**”) pursuant to and to the extent permitted by Section 6223 of Title XI of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (“**Title XI 2015 BBA**”). The Partnership Representative is hereby directed and authorized to take whatever steps the General Partner, in its reasonable discretion, deems necessary or desirable to perfect such designation, including filing any forms or documents with the IRS and taking such other action as may from time to time be required under the Treasury Regulations and directing the General Partner to take any of the foregoing actions. The Partnership Representative is hereby directed and authorized to designate an individual as the sole individual through whom the Partnership Representative will act for purposes of Subchapter C of Chapter 63 of Subtitle F of the Code; provided that prior to such designation the Partnership Representative shall cause such individual to agree in writing to be bound by the terms of this clause. Such designated individual shall be bound by the same obligations and restrictions imposed on the Partnership Representative hereunder. In the event of any pending tax action, investigation, claim or controversy at the Fund level that may result in a “partnership adjustment,” within the meaning of Section 6241(2) of Title XI 2015 BBA (a “**Partnership Adjustment**”), to any item reported on a federal tax return of any Partner(s), the Partnership Representative, shall keep such Partner(s) reasonably informed by written notice of any audit, administrative or judicial proceedings, meetings or conferences with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or other similar matters that come to its attention in its capacity as Partnership Representative.

         -  all expenses incurred by the Partnership Representative in connection with any income tax audit of any tax return of the Fund, the filing of any amended return or claim for refund in connection with any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit reflected on any tax return of the Fund, or any administrative or judicial proceedings arising out of or in connection with any such audit, amended return, claim for refund or denial of such claim (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’, accountants’ and other experts’ fees and disbursements) shall be expenses of the Fund (such expenses, “Tax Audit and Controversy Costs”);
            provided, however, that all or any portion of any Tax Audit and Controversy Costs that the General Partner reasonably believes were incurred solely due to the tax status, tax needs, or tax reporting requirements of one or more Partners shall be allocated only to such one or more Partners; 
            provided, further, that, for the avoidance of doubt, the preceding sentence shall not prohibit or limit the General Partner’s ability to allocate any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit to any Partner in respect of a Partnership Adjustment implemented in accordance with this Agreement and applicable law. 
            Without the consent of the General Partner, as applicable, no other Partner shall have the right to 
            - participate in the audit of any Fund tax return, 
            - file any return inconsistent with, or file any amended return or claim for refund in connection with, any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit reflected on any tax return of the Fund,
            - participate in any administrative or judicial proceedings arising out of or in connection with any audit, amended return, claim for refund or denial of such claim, or 
            -  appeal, challenge or otherwise protest any adverse findings in any such audit or with respect to any such amended return or claim for refund or in any such administrative or judicial proceedings.
      1. For any Partnership Adjustment or proposed Partnership Adjustment to the federal income tax returns of the Fund for which an “imputed underpayment,” within the meaning of Section 6225(b) of Title XI 2015 BBA would arise, then,
         - the Partnership Representative may require that the Partner(s) affected by such Partnership Adjustment file amended returns that take into account such Partnership Adjustments and pay any additional tax due pursuant to Section 6225(c) of Title XI 2015 BBA and/or 
         -  the Partnership Representative may elect application of Section 6226 of Title XI 2015 BBA. 
            In any case, 
            - the affected Partner(s) shall keep the Partnership Representative fully and timely informed by written notice of any administrative or judicial proceedings, meetings or conferences with the IRS or other similar matters with respect to the Partnership Adjustment, 
            - the General Partner shall allocate any imputed underpayment, interest, and related costs among the Partners in an equitable manner, taking into account the status of each Partner, and
            - the Partnership Representative shall have the right to review and comment on any submissions to the IRS, and attend and jointly participate in any meetings or conferences with the IRS at its own expense.  
      1. This **clause [ref-clause="fund-representative-audits"]** is intended to apply to the Fund for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2018 and to comply with certain provisions under Title XI 2015 BBA that may be subject to change or further interpretation by the U.S. Treasury or IRS after the date hereof.
   1. #### [clause="tax-matters"] Tax Matters
      1. **Partnership Classification for Tax Purposes**. Except to the extent otherwise required by applicable law (disregarding for this purpose any requirement that can be avoided through the filing of an election or similar administrative procedure), the General Partner shall cause the Fund to take the position that the Fund is a “partnership” for applicable Federal, State and local income tax purposes and shall cause to be filed with the appropriate tax authorities any elections or other documents necessary to give due legal effect to such position. A Partner shall not file (and each Partner hereby represents that it has not filed) any income tax election or other document that is inconsistent with the Fund’s position regarding its classification as a “partnership” for applicable United States (including Federal, State and local) income tax purposes.
      1. **Notice of Inconsistent Treatment of Fund Item**. No Partner shall file a notice with any governmental tax authority in connection with such Partner’s treatment of an item on such Partner’s income or other tax return or report in a manner which is inconsistent with the treatment of such item on the Fund’s corresponding return or report unless such Partner has, not less than 30 days prior to the filing of such notice (or such shorter period as is approved by the General Partner in its discretion); provided that the General Partner with a copy of such notice and thereafter in a timely manner provides such other information related thereto as the General Partner shall reasonably request.
      1. **Notice of Settlement Agreement**. Any Limited Partner entering into a settlement agreement with a governmental tax authority that concerns a Fund item shall notify the General Partner of such settlement agreement and those of its terms relating to the Fund within 60 days after the date thereof.
      1. **Side Letter Provisions**. The General Partner is authorized to comply with the terms of any side letter entered into with a Limited Partner with respect to tax matters.
   1. #### [clause="inv-adviser"] Investment Adviser
      1. [clause="inv-adviser-a"] The General Partner may retain and enter into an agreement with respect to the Fund (as amended from time to time, the “**Investment Advisory Agreement**”) with any Person that is an Affiliate of the General Partner (any such investment manager referred to herein as the “**Investment Adviser**”), and arrange for such Investment Adviser, pursuant to such Investment Advisory Agreement, to implement the Fund’s investment strategy in accordance with the Fund’s purpose as set forth in **clause [ref-clause="name-purpose"]**, investment objectives, policies and restrictions, to provide day-to-day managerial and administrative services and to perform such other acts as may be approved by the General Partner.

      1. The General Partner may, in its sole discretion, delegate to the Investment Adviser any of the management or administrative responsibilities of the General Partner under this Agreement; provided, however, that the General Partner may delegate to the Investment Adviser the authority to select investment opportunities or to make investment-related decisions on behalf of the Partnership only to the extent that:
         - such activities by the Investment Adviser are subject to the supervision of the General Partner; and
         - the General Partner has the power to terminate such delegation in its sole discretion. Any such delegation shall not relieve the General Partner of its own duties and obligations to the Fund as set forth in this Agreement. 
        1. In the event that the Fund’s investments in the Target Company may cause the Fund to no longer qualify as a “venture capital fund” as defined in Rule 203(l)-1 promulgated under the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Adviser believes that it is in the Fund’s best interest to continue investing in the Target Company, {{carta.investment_advisor_name}} reserves the right to resign as Investment Adviser by giving notice to the Limited Partners (which notice may be delivered on the Platform). 
      1. In the event {{carta.investment_advisor_name}} desires to resign pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the Limited Partners hereby consent to and authorize {{carta.investment_advisor_name}} to amend this Agreement as necessary to appoint a successor Investment Adviser that is an independent registered or exempt reporting “investment adviser” under the Investment Advisers Act to succeed {{carta.investment_advisor_name}} as Investment Adviser, without the further consent of the Limited Partners; provided, however, that such successor Investment Adviser shall not be permitted to increase any fees or carried interest payable by the Fund to the Investment Adviser hereunder without the Limited Partners’ consent and shall follow the same general investment strategy set forth herein (provided that such successor Investment Adviser may chose not to adhere to a technical 20% limit on investments that are not “qualifying investments” as defined in Rule 203(l)-1 promulgated under the Investment Advisers Act). If {{carta.investment_advisor_name}} resigns as Investment Adviser and has not designated a successor Investment Adviser, then a successor Investment Adviser shall be appointed by the General Partner with the consent of the Required Limited Partners. A successor Investment Adviser shall become the Investment Adviser to the Fund, effective upon the resignation of {{carta.investment_advisor_name}} from such role pursuant to this clause; provided, however, that prior to such Person becoming the Investment Adviser, such Person shall have executed an Investment Advisory Agreement with the General Partner.

   1. #### [clause="general-provisions-transfers"] General Provisions Regarding Transfers
      1. [clause="general-provisions-transfers-a"] **General**. No Limited Partner shall Transfer all or any portion of its interest in the Fund without the prior consent of the General Partner, which consent may be given or withheld, or made subject to such conditions as are determined by the General Partner, in the General Partner’s discretion.

Notwithstanding **clause [ref-clause="general-provisions-transfers-a"]**, but subject to meeting the requirements of **clause [ref-clause="general-provisions-transfers-b"]**, **[ref-clause="general-provisions-transfers-c"]** and **[ref-clause="general-provisions-transfers-d"]**, the General Partner shall not unreasonably withhold its consent with regard to the Transfer of a Limited Partner’s interest:

         - in the case of any Limited Partner that is a trustee of a trust, to any successor trustee of such trust;
         - in the case of a Limited Partner that is a trust, to any successor trust; or

            - the transferee has the authority and liquid assets to satisfy the obligations of the transferor in respect of the Transferred interest and, 
            - except with regard to a Transfer described in clause (i) of this sentence, the General Partner has not determined that a principal purpose or effect of the Transfer is to change the ultimate beneficial ownership of the interest.
        1. The General Partner may withhold its consent for any Transfer described in **clause [ref-clause="general-provisions-transfers-b"]** to the extent that: 
         - the transferor would not thereby assign its entire interest in the Fund to one Person; or
         - the Fund, immediately following such Transfer, would be deemed to have a larger number of beneficial owners of its Securities for purposes of Section 3(c)(1) of the Investment Company Act than the Fund had immediately prior to such Transfer.
      1. [clause="general-provisions-transfers-c"] **Prohibited Transfers**. There shall be no Transfer of an interest in the Fund if the General Partner determines that such Transfer would:
         - result in a violation of, or a requirement that the interests of the Fund be registered under, the Securities Act or under the securities laws of any State or foreign country;
         - give rise to a requirement that the Fund or any Affiliate of the Fund register as an investment company or elect to be a “business development company” under the Investment Company Act or any corresponding provision of other applicable law; 
            - give rise to a requirement that any GP Related Person, to the extent such Person is not registered or required to be registered immediately prior to the effectuation of said Transfer, register as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act or any corresponding provision of other applicable law;
            -  otherwise subject the Fund, or any GP Related Person to additional regulatory requirements under applicable law, compliance with which would subject the Fund or such other GP Related Person to material expense or burden (unless each such affected Person consents to such Transfer);

         - violate any applicable law, or result in a violation thereof by the Fund or any GP Related Person. 
      1. [clause="general-provisions-transfers-d"] **Conditions of Transfer**. In connection with each Transfer of an interest in the Fund, the transferee shall not be admitted as a “Substitute Limited Partner”: 
         - unless the transferor and transferee shall execute and deliver to the Fund a written instrument of transfer in form and substance satisfactory to the General Partner;
         - unless otherwise waived by the General Partner, the transferor shall provide to the General Partner, either:   
         - an opinion of counsel to such transferor satisfactory in form and substance to counsel for the Fund with respect to the matters described in **clause [ref-clause="general-provisions-transfers-c"]**; or 
         - sufficient information to allow counsel for the Fund to make a determination that the proposed Transfer will not result in any of the consequences described in **clause [ref-clause="general-provisions-transfers-c"]** and that such transferee meets all investor suitability standards and complies with any applicable anti-money laundering requirements that the General Partner may require; and  
         -  all reasonable legal, accounting and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred or estimated to be incurred by the Fund on account of the Transfer (or proposed Transfer) shall be paid by the transferor, regardless of whether such proposed Transfer is completed; provided that, following the effective date of any Transfer, the transferor and transferee shall be jointly and severally liable for all such expenses and the General Partner may elect to deduct such expenses from any distribution otherwise payable to transferee. At the General Partner’s election, the Fund may seek reimbursement of such expenses through
            - a direct reimbursement by the transferor or transferee either following the Transfer (or proposed effective date of the Transfer) or as a condition precedent to the General Partner providing such required consent, or 
            - withholding of distributions that otherwise would be made to the transferor or transferee. The General Partner may require the transferee agree to deduct and withhold any taxes required to be withheld by the transferee pursuant to applicable law, including pursuant to Section 1446(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, and if the transferee fails to do so, the General Partner may deduct such taxes (plus any applicable interest and penalties) from amounts otherwise attributable to the transferee.  
      1. **Right of First Offer**. Any proposed Transfer by a Limited Partner (other than a Transfer pursuant to **clause [ref-clause="general-provisions-transfers-b"]**) is subject to a right of first offer in favor of the General Partner. With respect thereto, a Limited Partner must provide 30 calendar days’ prior written notice to the General Partner of any proposed Transfer, identifying the proposed transferee(s), the purchase price and other terms. The General Partner will be deemed to have waived its right of first offer if not exercised within 30 calendar days of receipt of such notice. 
      1. **Effect of Noncompliant Transfer**. Any Transfer in violation of **clause [ref-clause="general-provisions-transfers"]** shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law,

         - not be recognized or permitted by, or duly reflected in the official books and records of, the Fund.  
      1. **Assignee Status**. Unless admitted as Substitute Limited Partner in accordance with the provisions of this **clause [ref-clause="general-provisions-transfers"]** , the proposed transferee of all or any portion of a Limited Partner’s interest in the Fund (including by operation law) shall not be a Substitute Limited Partner, but instead shall be an assignee and be entitled to receive the allocations attributable to such interest pursuant to Section 3, to receive the distributions attributable to such interest pursuant to Section 4 and Section 7, but shall not, solely by virtue of its status as such, hold any non-economic rights in the Fund and the proposed transferor shall remain a Limited Partner. . To the extent otherwise applicable to the interest in the Fund that has been Transferred to or is otherwise held by an assignee, the assignee shall be subject to, and bound by, all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement that inure to the benefit of the Fund or any Partner (without regard to whether such assignee has executed a written instrument of transfer described in **clause [ref-clause="general-provisions-transfers-d"]**). All restrictions and obligations applicable to a Limited Partner concerning a Transfer of its interest in the Fund pursuant to this Section 7 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to any Transfer by an assignee of an interest in the Fund. The Fund may, at any time and in the discretion of the General Partner, redeem (or cause the sale of) the interest in the Fund of any assignee for the Fair Market Value; provided, however, that such Fair Market Value be paid by the Fund by cash, Securities or non-interest-bearing promissory note payable solely from distributions that otherwise would have been made to such assignee and otherwise on terms determined by the General Partner in its discretion.
   1. [clause="removal-partner"]  #### Withdrawal/Removal of a limited partner
        A Limited Partner shall not withdraw from the Fund or otherwise cease to be a Limited Partner without the consent of the General Partner, which consent may be granted or withheld in the General Partner’s discretion. Except as provided in **clause [ref-clause="failure-to-make-cap-contribution"]**, no Limited Partner shall be removed from the Fund 
         -  without the consent of each of such Limited Partner and the General Partner, or
         -  unless the General Partner determines that the continued undiminished membership of such Limited Partner in the Fund would 
            - constitute or give rise to a violation of applicable law or 
            - otherwise subject the Fund or any GP Related Person to material onerous legal, tax or other regulatory requirements that cannot reasonably be avoided without material adverse consequences to such Person. 
         In the event of a Limited Partner’s removal pursuant to the foregoing **clause [ref-clause="removal-partner"] (b)**, the Fund will redeem such Limited Partner’s interest for the Fair Market Value; provided, however, that such redemption price may be paid by the Fund by cash, Securities or non-interest-bearing promissory note payable solely from distributions that otherwise would have been made to such Limited Partner and otherwise on terms determined by the General Partner in its discretion.

Upon an event of termination of the Fund, the liquidating trustee shall as promptly as practicable wind up the affairs and liquidate the Fund and shall engage in no other business activities except as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable discretion of the liquidating trustee, to preserve the value of the Fund’s assets during the period of winding-up and liquidation.

1. ### Exculpation and indemnification
   1. #### Exculpation

      1. The Protected Persons may consult with counsel, accountants, and valuation firms in respect of Fund affairs and be fully protected and justified in any action or inaction that is taken in good faith reliance upon the advice or opinion of such counsel, accountants, and valuation firms; provided that they shall have been selected with reasonable care.
      1. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this clause shall not relieve (or attempt to relieve) a Protected Person of liability for its Material Misconduct or to the extent (but only to the extent) that such liability may not be waived, modified, or limited under applicable law. 
      1. This clause is intended solely to limit the liability of Protected Persons and shall in no event be interpreted to impose liability that would not exist in the absence of this Section 8.1.
      1. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, to the extent that at law or in equity, a Protected Person has duties (including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to the Fund, any Partner or any other Person bound by this Agreement, such Protected Person acting under this Agreement shall not be liable to the Fund, any Partner or any other Person bound by this Agreement for breach of fiduciary duty for its good faith reliance on the provisions of this Agreement, and the provisions of this Agreement, to the extent that they restrict or modify the duties (including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto of a Protected Person otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by each Partner and the Fund to so modify such other duties and liabilities of such Protected Person.
   1. #### [clause="indemnification"]Indemnification   
      1. [clause="indemnification-gen"]**General**. The Fund shall, solely out of the assets of the Fund (including amounts that may be required to be returned pursuant to **clause [ref-clause="distributions-subject-return"]**), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, indemnify and hold each Protected Person harmless from and against any loss, cost, expense of any nature, judgment, penalty, settlement, compromise, damage, injury suffered or sustained, or any other amount, or any nature whatsoever, known or unknown, liquidated or unliquidated (collectively, “Indemnifiable Amounts”), suffered by such Protected Person by reason of any actual or threatened claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding (civil, criminal, administrative or investigative)(each, an “Action”) in which such Protected Person may be involved, as a party or otherwise, in connection with the Fund or their performance or nonperformance of any act on behalf of the Fund (including a Protected Person’s involvement as an officer, director or other role with an issuer of Portfolio Assets or in the offering of interests in the Fund); provided, however, that such indemnification shall not extend to 
         -  any Indemnifiable Amounts caused directly by Material Misconduct, or 
         -  any Action arising solely from an internal dispute between or among any GP Related Persons. The General Partner may enter into separate agreements with Protected Persons on terms consistent with this clause.
         Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this clause, the Fund shall be under no obligation to indemnify a Protected Person from and against any reduction in the value of such Person’s interest in the Fund that is attributable to losses, expenses, damages, or injuries suffered by the Fund or to any other decline in the value of the Fund’s assets.
      1. **Advances; Obligation to Return Payments**. The Fund may, at the election of the General Partner, advance Indemnifiable Amounts to a Protected Person if such Indemnifiable Amounts will be incurred in connection with any Action described in **clause [ref-clause="indemnification-gen"]**. As a condition to receiving an advance toward or payment of Indemnifiable Amounts pursuant to this clause, a Protected Person shall execute an undertaking in form and substance acceptable to the General Partner providing that, to the extent that it is subsequently determined in a final judgment or other final adjudication by arbitration proceeding in accordance with **clause [ref-clause="dispute-resolution"]** that such Person was not entitled to such advance or payment, such Person shall promptly return such advance or payment to the Fund. If a Protected Person is a defendant in an Action brought by a Majority-In-Interest of the Limited Partners in their capacity as such, such Protected Person shall be entitled to an advance of Indemnifiable Amounts under this Section 9.2(b) with respect to such Action only with the approval of a Majority-In-Interest of the Limited Partners.
      1. **Other Rights to Indemnification**. The indemnification provided by this **clause [ref-clause="indemnification"]** shall not be deemed to be exclusive of, or otherwise to diminish, any other rights to which any Protected Person may be entitled under any agreement, as a matter of law, in equity or otherwise. Solely for purposes of clarification, and without expanding the scope of indemnification pursuant to this **clause [ref-clause="indemnification"]**, the Partners expressly intend that the provisions of this **clause [ref-clause="indemnification"]** shall be interpreted to reflect an ordering of liability for potentially overlapping or duplicative indemnification payments, with any third party (e.g., issuer of Portfolio Assets or insurance company) having primary liability, the Fund having only secondary liability, and the General Partner or Investment Adviser having only tertiary liability. If the Fund pays or causes to be paid, for any reason, any amounts that should have been paid by a third party, then
         -  the Fund shall be fully subrogated to all rights of the relevant Protected Person with respect to such payment, and 
         -  each relevant Protected Person shall assign to the Fund all of the Protected Person’s rights to advancement or indemnification from or with respect to such third party.
             Nothing in this clause will prohibit the General Partner from causing the Fund to make such payments or requiring the Partners to return distributions pursuant to **clause [ref-clause="distributions-subject-return"]** if the General Partner determines in its discretion that the Fund is not likely to obtain sufficient funds from such other sources in a timely fashion, or that attempting to obtain such funds would be futile or not in the best interests of the Fund.
            If a Protected Person has received payments from the Fund pursuant to this **clause [ref-clause="indemnification"]** and also receives duplicative indemnification payments from an issuer of Portfolio Assets for the same Indemnifiable Amounts, such Protected Person shall repay the Fund as soon as practicable to the extent of such duplicative payments. As used in this Section 8.2.3, “indemnification” from or with respect to such third party shall be deemed to include, 
         - advancement of expenses with regard to indemnification obligations; 
         - payments made or to be made by any successor to the indemnification obligations of such third party; and
         - equivalent payments made or to be made by or on behalf of such third party (or such successor) pursuant to an insurance policy or similar arrangement.

      1. To the extent a Limited Partner is a Rule 506(d) Related Party (as reasonably determined by the General Partner), its voting and consent rights in its capacity as a Limited Partner of the Fund shall be deemed reduced to a level sufficient to preclude such Limited Partner’s qualification as a Rule 506(d) Related Party if such Limited Partner is or becomes a “bad actor” within the meaning of Rule 506(b) under the Securities Act, for such time as such Limited Partner remains both a Rule 506(d) Related Party and a “bad actor” within the meaning of Rule 506(b) under the Securities Act; provided that, such reduction shall apply only during such times as new interests in the Fund are being offered.
