This Confidential Private Placement Memorandum (this “**Memorandum**”) is being delivered on behalf of {{ carta.fund_name }} (the “**Fund**”), a series of  {{carta.master_entity_name}}, a Delaware multi-series limited partnership (the “**Master Partnership**”), in connection with the private placement of Class A limited partnership interests in the Fund (the “**Class A Interests**”) to certain United States accredited investors as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “**Securities Act**”) and Class B limited partnership interests in the Fund (the “**Class B Interests**” and, together with the Class A Interest, the “**Interests**”) to certain non-United States persons pursuant to Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act.  

This Memorandum and the information contained herein are for the prospective investor to whom it is being delivered and distribution of this Memorandum to any person other than such prospective investor and those persons retained to advise such prospective investor with respect thereto is unauthorized, and any reproduction of this Memorandum, in whole or in part, or disclosure of any of its contents without the prior written consent of the general partner of the Fund (the “**General Partner**”) is prohibited. Each prospective investor, by accepting delivery of this Memorandum, agrees to return it and all other related documents to the Fund and the Master Partnership if the prospective investor decides not to invest in the Fund, if its subscription is rejected or if the offering is terminated.

The offer and sale of the Interests have not been registered with or approved or disapproved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “**Commission**”) or the securities commission or regulatory authority of any state or foreign jurisdiction, nor has the Commission or any such state or foreign securities commission or regulatory authority passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of this Memorandum. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense. 

The Interests have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “**Securities Act**”), the securities laws of any state or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, nor is such registration contemplated. This Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy the interest as to any person in which it is unlawful to make such an offer or solicitation.  Within the United States, this offering is made as a private placement pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, and only to parties that are “accredited investors” as defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act.  Outside of the United States, this offering is made pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act, only to parties that are not “U.S. persons” as defined in such regulation, and pursuant to exemptions from applicable securities laws of other countries (“**Non-U.S. Securities Laws**”).  The Fund will not be registered as an investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “**Investment Company Act**”).

This offering is made in reliance upon exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and Non-U.S. Securities Laws as described above.  The Fund will not be obligated to register the interests under the Securities Act or any Non-U.S. Securities Laws in the future.  There is no public market for the Interests and no such market is expected to develop in the future. The Interests may not be sold or transferred (i) except as permitted under the Fund’s limited partnership agreement (as amended or restated from time to time, the “**Partnership Agreement**”) and the Master Partnership’s limited partnership agreement (as amended or restated from time to time, the “**Master Partnership Agreement**” and, together with the Partnership Agreement, the “**Fund Agreements**”) and (ii) unless they are registered under the Securities Act and under any other applicable securities laws or an exemption from such registration thereunder is available.

The distribution of this Memorandum and the offer and sale of the Interests in certain jurisdictions may be restricted by law. This Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy in any state or other U.S. or non-U.S. jurisdiction to any person to whom it is unlawful to make such offer or solicitation in such state or jurisdiction. It is the responsibility of any prospective investor to satisfy itself as to the full compliance of the applicable laws and regulations of any relevant territory, including obtaining any governmental or other consent and observing any other formality prescribed in such territory. All prospective investors should inform themselves as to the legal requirements applicable to them in respect of the acquisition, holding and disposition of an Interest and as to the income and other tax consequences applicable to them. This offering does not constitute an offer of the Interests to the public, and no action has been or will be taken to permit a public offering in any jurisdiction where action would be required for that purpose. The Interests may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and this Memorandum may not be distributed in any jurisdiction, except in accordance with the legal requirements applicable in such jurisdiction. Prospective investors should inform themselves as to the legal requirements and tax consequences within the countries of their citizenship, residence, domicile and place of business with respect to the acquisition, holding or disposal of the Interests, and any foreign exchange restrictions that may be relevant thereto.

THE INTERESTS OFFERED HEREBY ARE SPECULATIVE AND INVOLVE A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE OF RISK. INVESTMENT IN THE FUND IS SUITABLE ONLY FOR SOPHISTICATED INVESTORS AND REQUIRES THE FINANCIAL ABILITY AND WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT THE HIGH RISKS AND LACK OF LIQUIDITY INHERENT IN AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUND. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE FUND WILL BE SUCCESSFUL OR THAT LOSSES WILL NOT BE INCURRED BY THE FUND. EACH INVESTOR IN THE FUND MUST HAVE THE ABILITY TO BEAR THE RISK OF LOSS OF ITS ENTIRE INVESTMENT.

1. ###[clause="target-company"] Target Company

    **Target Company**
   {{carta.investment_opportunity_target_company_name}} <br> {{carta.target_country or "" | country}}


    **Investment**
    The Fund’s investment objective is to seek capital appreciation by generally investing in one operating company.  Consistent with this objective, the Fund intends to invest only in the Target Company.  The investment in the Target Company will be an amount equal to the total subscriptions less the amounts reserved for administration fees and management fees, as applicable.  
    The Fund may provide the earliest, or among the earliest, financing for the Target Company, which may have not yet implemented any or much of its business plan and may have little or no current revenues or earnings.  This is among the riskiest of venture investments, as certain key elements of successful businesses may not yet be present with respect to the Target Company.  Accordingly, the likelihood that an investment in the Target Company is likely to lose all of its value is higher than in most other investments.  To the extent that the Target Company develops into a successful business, the Fund’s investment may be subject to significant dilution.  
    Neither the General Partner nor the Investment Adviser will determine the price at which the Fund acquires the Target Securities and the Fund will hold the Target Securities until there is a liquidity event, after which the Fund will distribute to the Limited Partners as soon as practicable the Target Securities or the net proceeds (whether in the form of cash or other securities) realized by the Fund in connection with a liquidity event.  

[new-page] 

1. ###[clause="conflicts-of-interests"] CERTAIN INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

    *An investment in the Fund involves a significant amount of risk and is suitable only for sophisticated investors of substantial means who have no immediate need for liquidity in the amount invested, and who understand and can afford a risk of loss of all or a substantial part of the investment. There can be no assurance that any returns will be realized or that a Limited Partner will receive a return of its capital. In addition, potential investors should be aware that there will be occasions when the General Partner, the Investment Adviser, and their affiliates may encounter potential conflicts of interest in connection with the structure and operation of the Fund.  None of the agreements and arrangements between the Fund and the General Partner, the Investment Adviser, and their affiliates, including the compensation payable by the Fund to the General Partner, the Investment Adviser, or their affiliates, are the result of arm’s-length negotiations. Accordingly, each potential investor should read this Memorandum, the Fund Agreements and the Subscription Agreement carefully, consult with their attorney and business and/or investment advisor and carefully consider the following factors, among others, before making an investment in the Fund.  THE FOLLOWING RISKS ARE JUST A FEW OF THE MANY SIGNIFICANT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUND AND DO NOT REPRESENT MOST OR ALL OF THE CURRENT AND FUTURE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUND.*

    **Certain Risk Factors**

    ***Investments in Securities of a Single Target Company.*** The Fund is expected to invest in Target Securities of only the Target Company. There is no assurance that the Fund’s investments will be profitable and there is a substantial risk that losses and expenses will exceed income and gains. The General Partner will have no management control of the Target Company, and the marketability and value of the Target Securities will depend upon many factors beyond the General Partner’s control. The Target Company may need substantial additional capital to support growth or to achieve or maintain its operations. Such capital may not be available on attractive terms. The Fund’s capital will be limited and may not be adequate to protect it from dilution in multiple rounds of Target Company financings. The public market for high technology and other emerging growth companies is extremely volatile. Such volatility may adversely affect the ability of the Fund to dispose of the Target Securities or other investments, and the value of investment securities on the date of sale or distribution by the Fund. In particular, the receptiveness of the public market to initial public offerings by the Target Company may vary dramatically from period to period. The Target Company may yield poor investment returns if it is unable to consummate an initial public offering at the proper time. Even if the Target Company effects a successful public offering, the Fund or the Target Securities typically will be subject to contractual “lock-up,” securities law or other restrictions which may, for a material period of time, prevent the Fund or the Partners from disposing of such securities. Similarly, the receptiveness of potential acquirors to the Target Company will vary over time and, even if the Target Securities are disposed of via a merger, consolidation or similar transaction, the Fund’s stock, security or other interests in the surviving entity may not be marketable. There can be no guarantee that the Target Securities or other securities held by the Fund will result in a liquidity event via public offering, merger, acquisition or otherwise, and there is a significant risk that the Fund’s investments will yield little or no return. The Target Company may lack one or more key attributes (e.g., proven technology, appropriate patent protection, marketable product, complete management team, or strategic alliances) necessary for success. The Target Company will be dependent for its success upon the development, implementation, marketing and customer acceptance of new technologies that can be rendered obsolete or otherwise unattractive at any time. In most cases, investments will be long term in nature and may require many years from the date of initial investment before disposition.

	***Information on the Target Company may be Incomplete and not Available.*** Public information on the Target Company may be difficult to obtain or verify. The Investment Adviser may find it cost-prohibitive to obtain certain information that would be easily obtainable in more developed countries. While the Investment Adviser will endeavor to conduct appropriate due diligence on the Target Company, no assurance can be given that it will obtain the information or assurances that an investor in a more sophisticated economy would generally expect to obtain before committing to an investment. The information of the Target Company may be incomplete, and certain major information may not be available to the General Partner, the Investment Adviser and the Limited Partners, including information that will affect the valuation and projection of the Target Company. The Investment Adviser will not have the resources to undertake extensive due diligence with respect to an investment in the Target Securities and will be relying upon information provided by the Target Company with respect to direct investments or the judgment of angel investors or managers of other funds in which, or alongside of which, the Fund may invest with respect to indirect investments or co-investments.  Furthermore, the Target Company and its management are subject to numerous conflicts of interest. In preparing information for prospective investors, a Target Company and its management may have an incentive to select or format information in a manner that could be deemed to overly emphasize positive attributes over negatives attributes, and they may lack the discipline that is enforced in a public company context by independent auditors, research analysts, lengthy operating histories, and experienced financial and other executives, personnel, and systems.  Therefore, the investment result by the Fund in the Target Company is highly unpredictable and involves a high degree of risks, including a total loss of the invested capital of the Limited Partners. 
	
   ***No Portfolio Diversification.*** The Fund intends to invest solely in the Target Company and the Target Securities. A downturn in the business of the Target Company will negatively impact the returns delivered to Limited Partners by the Fund as a result of lack of diversification. 
	
	***Operating History of the Fund.*** The Fund does not have any significant business history or operating experience that investors can analyze to aid them in making an informed judgment as to the merits of an investment in the Fund. The Fund has been newly organized to invest in the Target Company. There can be no assurance that the Fund will be able to generate revenues, gains or income, or, even if it generates revenues, gains or income, that its investments will be profitable. Any investment in the Fund should be considered a high-risk investment because investors will be placing their funds at risk in an unseasoned start-up investment vehicle with the attendant unforeseen costs, expenses, and problems to which a new business is often subject.
	
	***Risks Associated with Passive Investments.***  Although the Fund will be making venture capital investments through a passive strategy, all venture capital investments are speculative in nature, and the possibility of partial or total loss of capital will exist. The General Partner will not have or will have little control over the day-to-day management of a Target Company.
	
    ***Risks Inherent in Investing through a Delaware Series Limited Partnership.***  Under Delaware law, a limited partnership (“**LP**”) may be composed of individual series of limited partner interests. The Fund has been created as a series of the Master Partnership. This type of entity is referred to as a Series LP. Each series effectively is treated as a separate entity, meaning the debts; liabilities, obligations and expenses of one series cannot be enforced against another series of the LP or against the LP as a whole. Each series can hold its own assets, have its own partners, conduct its own operations and pursue different business objectives, but remain insulated from claims of partners, creditors or litigants pursuing the assets of or asserting claims against another series. There is a certain degree of uncertainty surrounding the Series LP form. For example, the legal separation of the assets and liabilities of each series in a Series LP has not been tested in court. Although Delaware law clearly provides for legal separation of series, it is unclear whether courts in other states and/or jurisdictions would recognize a legal separation of assets and liabilities within what is technically a single entity. Therefore, even if a Delaware Series LP was properly operated with distinct records relating to the assets and liabilities of each series, a court in another jurisdiction could determine not to recognize the legal separation afforded under Delaware law. There is also uncertainty as to how the IRS will treat the separation of Series LPs for tax purposes. The IRS has reserved the right to impose the tax liability of one series onto a master entity or another series under the master entity. The tax treatment of series is also unclear. It is possible that the debts, liabilities, and other obligations of one series of the master entity may lead to action against another series of the master entity. There would be a material effect on the Fund if various series of the Master Partnership are not treated as separate entities.   

    ***Reliance on Target Company Management.***  The Fund will not have an active role in the day-to-day management of the Target Company. To the extent that the senior management of the Target Company performs poorly, or if a key manager of the Target Company terminates employment, the Fund’s investment in the Target Company could be adversely affected. The returns of the Fund will depend in large part on the performance of these unrelated individuals and could be substantially adversely affected by the unfavorable performance of a small number of those individuals. 

    ***Long-Term Investment.*** An investment in the Fund is a long-term commitment and there is no assurance of any distribution to the Partners. There is not now and there is not expected to be a public market for the Interests.  As described below, the Interests may not be assigned, transferred or encumbered without the prior written consent of the General Partner.  Accordingly, a Limited Partner may not be able to liquidate its investment and must be prepared to bear the risks of owning its Interest for an extended period of time. The Interests will not be registered under the Securities Act, or under the various “blue sky” or securities laws of the state or jurisdiction of residence of any Limited Partner.  The inability to transfer Interests in the Fund may limit the availability of estate planning strategies.

    ***Limited Transferability of Interests; Resignation.*** The Fund Agreements and applicable securities laws will impose substantial restrictions upon the transferability of the Interests. There is no public or other market for Interests, and it is not expected that such a market will develop. Resignation of Limited Partners from the Fund generally will not be permitted, although the Fund Agreements may specify certain circumstances under which a Limited Partner may be entitled, or required, to resign from the Fund. A resigned Limited Partner may not be entitled to immediate payment for its Interest in the Fund.

    ***Classes of Interests.***  The Fund may from time to time create additional classes of Interests that provide additional and/or different rights compared to other classes of Interests (including, without limitation, with respect to management fees, carried interest and minimum investment amounts). Such additional and/or different rights may result in certain classes of Interests’ experiencing more favorable outcomes than other classes of Interests. Though the General Partner expects to offer existing Limited Partners the right to acquire classes of Interests created after the date on which such Limited Partners initially purchased their Interests, the General Partner is under no obligation to notify any Limited Partner of the creation of any class of Interest or of the rights, terms or provisions of such classes of Interests, or to offer any such class of Interest to any Limited Partner. Limited Partners will have no recourse against the Fund, the General Partner, the Investment Adviser and/or any of their affiliates in the event that certain Limited Partners receive additional and/or different rights and/or terms as a result of their holding different classes of Interests.

    ***Competition.*** The venture capital/private equity business is highly competitive, and has become more so in recent years due to a substantially increased flow of capital into venture capital/private equity funds and similar investment organizations. The Fund, the General Partner and the Investment Adviser will be competing with other funds and investment organizations with substantial resources and experience. There can be no assurance that the Fund will be able to complete the investment in the Target Company.
	
    ***Changes in Environment.*** The General Partner will have the exclusive right and authority (within limitations set forth in the Fund Agreements) to determine the manner in which the Fund shall respond to such changes, and Limited Partners generally will have no right to resign from the Fund or to demand specific modifications to the Fund’ operations in consequence thereof. Prospective investors are particularly cautioned that the investment sourcing, selection, management and liquidation strategies and procedures exercised in the past by the General Partner or the Investment Adviser may not be successful, or even practicable, during the Fund’s term. Within the limitations set forth in the Fund Agreements, the General Partner will have the right and authority to cause the Fund’s investment sourcing, selection, management and liquidation strategies and procedures to deviate from those described in this Memorandum.

    ***COVID-19 and Disease Outbreaks.***  In December 2019, a strain of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was reported to have surfaced, and in January 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency. COVID-19 has spread to many countries and has resulted in a widespread health crisis affecting economies and financial markets worldwide, as businesses and governments have taken broad actions to mitigate this public health crisis. The extent to which COVID-19 will impact the business of the Fund and the Target Company in which the Fund invests will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. If the disruptions posed by COVID-19 or other matters of global concern continue for an extensive period of time, the Fund’s and the Target Company’s abilities to consummate transactions and/or operate may be materially adversely affected. In addition, COVID-19 could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to raise funds, which could adversely affect the Fund’s ability to consummate investments. Significant outbreaks of other infectious diseases could have similar consequences to the Fund.
	
    ***Reliance on Third Parties.*** The General Partner and the Fund may require, and rely upon, the services of a variety of third parties, including but not limited to attorneys, accountants, bankers, brokers, custodians, consultants (including “finders” and similar persons engaged to assist with the development and exploitation of portfolio deal flow) and other agents. Failure by any of these third parties to perform their duties or otherwise satisfy their obligations to the Fund could have a material adverse effect upon the Fund. Except as otherwise provided in the Fund Agreements, the fees and costs associated with such third parties will be paid by the Fund.

    ***Limited Partner Defaults.*** Some Limited Partners may not contribute the full amount of their capital commitments to the Fund at the time of their admission to the Fund. Instead, they will be required to make incremental contributions pursuant to capital calls issued by the General Partner from time to time. Limited Partners that fail to satisfy capital calls in a timely manner generally will be subject to significant penalties in the Fund Agreements. Nevertheless, Limited Partners may default upon capital calls for a variety of reasons including their own insolvency, bankruptcy or subjective determination that default is more attractive than compliance. In addition, under certain circumstances, some Limited Partners may be excused from making capital contributions under applicable law or otherwise. Any failure by Limited Partners to make timely capital contributions in respect of their capital commitments may impair the ability of the Fund to pursue its investment program, force the Fund to borrow, or cause other damage.

    ***Reserves.*** In managing the Fund, the General Partner will establish reserves for operating expenses, Fund liabilities (including payment of the Management Fee and the Administration Fee), and other matters. Estimating the amount necessary for such reserves will be difficult, particularly because follow-on investment opportunities will be directly tied to the success and capital needs of portfolio companies. Inadequate or excessive reserves could have a material adverse effect upon the investment returns to the Limited Partners. For example, if reserves are inadequate, the Fund may be unable to take advantage of attractive follow-on or other investment opportunities or to protect its existing investments from dilutive or other punitive terms associated with a “pay-to-play” or similar investment round. If reserves are excessive, the Fund may decline attractive investment opportunities or hold unnecessary amounts of capital in money market or similar low-yield accounts.
	
    ***Dilution.*** Following the Fund’ initial closing, the General Partner will be authorized to admit additional Limited Partners (or accept increased capital commitments from existing Limited Partners) during a specified period (the “**Open Window Period**”). For purposes of allocating Fund profit and loss, all capital commitments made during the Open Window Period generally will be treated as if made at the Fund’s initial closing. In consequence, additional Limited Partners (or existing Limited Partners that increase their capital commitments) may effectively “buy into” the Fund during the Open Window Period at a price that does not necessarily reflect changes in the value of the Fund’ assets subsequent to the initial closing.

    ***Side Agreements.*** At its discretion, the General Partner may enter into one or more “side letters” or similar agreements with certain Limited Partners pursuant to which the General Partner grants to such Limited Partners specific rights, benefits or privileges that are not made available to Limited Partners generally. Such agreements will be disclosed only to those actual or potential Limited Partners that have separately negotiated with the General Partner for the right to review such agreements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prospective investors should be aware that the General Partner generally follows a policy of not issuing side letters. Prospective investors who typically require side letters should anticipate that their requests for a side letter in respect of the Fund will be denied.

    ***Representations and Warranties in the Subscription Agreement.***  The acknowledgments, representations, warranties and agreements contained in the Subscription Agreement and the other documents submitted by a potential Limited Partner as part of its Subscription Agreement (including investor questionnaires and any side letter, if applicable) will continue to survive for the duration of such Limited Partner’s investment in the Fund.

    ***Distributions in Kind.*** It is anticipated that the Fund will from time to time distribute Target Securities to the Partners. Except as specifically provided in the Fund Agreements, such distributions will be made solely at the discretion of the General Partner. Distributed securities may be subject to a variety of legal or practical limitations on sale. In particular, immediately following a distribution of securities, trading volume may be insufficient to support sales by the Partners without such sales triggering a price decline which makes it difficult or impossible for all Partners to sell such securities at the distribution price. Nevertheless, the distribution price of such securities will be established under the provisions of the Fund Agreements and will not be adjusted to reflect actual sale prices obtained by the Partners.

    ***No Assurance of Confidentiality.*** As part of the subscription process and otherwise in their capacity as Limited Partners, investors will provide significant amounts of information about themselves to the General Partner and the Fund. Under the terms of the Fund Agreements as well as applicable laws, such information may be made available to other Limited Partners, third parties that have dealings with the Fund, and governmental authorities (including by means of securities law-required information statements that are open to public inspection). 

    ***Functional Currency.*** The functional currency of the Fund will be United States dollars. Capital commitments of the Limited Partners, capital contributions, and distributions of cash generally will be stated, made or payable in United States dollars. An investor whose functional currency is not United States dollars will bear substantial risks associated with fluctuating currency exchange rates, particularly with regard to capital contributions that may not become due for several years.

    ***Non-United States Investments.*** The Fund may invest in securities of non-United States portfolio companies. Such investments may present a variety of risks not presented by investments in United States portfolio companies, including risks associated with: (i) fluctuating currency exchange rates; (ii) limitations on currency exchange or the transfer of capital/profits across international boundaries; (iii) different accounting standards; (iv) different legal protections for investors; (v) unusual regulatory burdens; (vi) political instability; and (vii) multiple taxing jurisdictions.

    Even those portfolio companies that nominally are United States portfolio companies by virtue of their jurisdiction of organization or management headquarters may be exposed to significant non-United States risks due to the increasingly international nature of many early stage and emerging companies (which may, for example, (i) rely upon international location or outsourcing of research, development, manufacturing or other operations; (ii) seek alliances with non-United States partners; or (iii) seek non-United States customers).

    Any adverse change to the political, economic, military or social environments in the host countries of the Fund’ portfolio companies could have a significant adverse effect upon the operations or financial performance of the Fund.

    ***AIFMD.*** The European Union (“**EU**”) Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (“**AIFMD**”) came into force on July 22, 2013. The AIFMD regulates the activities of private fund managers undertaking fund management activities or marketing fund interests to investors within the EU. If the Interests are marketed to EU-based investors: (i) the Fund will be subject to certain reporting, disclosure and other compliance obligations under the AIFMD, which may result in the Fund incurring additional costs and expenses; and (ii) the AIFMD will also restrict certain activities of the Fund in relation to EU portfolio companies including, in some circumstances, the Fund’ ability to recapitalize, refinance or potentially restructure an EU portfolio company within the first two years of ownership.

    ***Litigation Risks.*** The Fund will be subject to a variety of litigation risks, particularly in consequence of the substantial likelihood that the Target Company will face financial or other difficulties during the term of the Fund’ investment. In the event of a dispute arising from the foregoing (or other activities relating to the operation of the Fund or the General Partner), it is possible that the Fund, the General Partner or the Investment Adviser may be named as defendants. Under most circumstances, the Fund will indemnify, among others, the General Partner and the Investment Adviser for any costs they incur in connection with such disputes. Beyond direct costs, such disputes may adversely affect the Fund in a variety of ways, including by distracting the General Partner and harming relationships between the Fund and the Target Company or other investors in the Target Company.

    To the extent set forth in the Fund Agreements, Limited Partners may be required to return distributions previously received by them from the Fund in order to enable the Fund to make indemnification payments to the General Partner, the Investment Adviser or other indemnified persons. More generally, Limited Partners may be required to return distributions previously received by them from the Fund to the extent required by applicable law. Such a return obligation may occur, for example, if the Fund makes a distribution at a time when it is technically insolvent or otherwise unable to satisfy the claims of creditors.

    ***Regulatory Concerns.*** The Fund will be subject to a variety of securities laws and other types of governmental regulation in the United States and other jurisdictions that may limit the scope of its operations or impose material compliance costs and other burdens.  Future changes in the legal and regulatory environment may adversely affect the Fund’s employment of its investment objective and approach. Additional legislation and changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules may directly affect the Fund’s investments.

    In making this offering, the Fund is relying upon the availability of Rule 506 of Regulation D and Regulation S to exempt its offerings from registration under the Securities Act.  If the private placement exemptions relied upon are not available to the Fund and/or the General Partner for any reason, the Fund and General Partner may be required to offer to the investors the right to rescind their purchase of the Interests, which could have a material adverse effect on the Fund, its business, and its financial condition.  There is also no assurance that the Fund and/or the General Partner would have adequate funds to repay the Limited Partners if rescission were required.  Any related litigation with members and the SEC or other state, U.S. federal or local agencies or parties would also have a material adverse impact on the Fund.

    While the General Partner believes that the Fund will not be subject to the registration requirements of the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “**Investment Company Act**”), there can be no assurance that this belief is, or will continue to be, correct. The General Partner may require the complete or partial withdrawal by a Limited Partner should the Limited Partner's continued investment in the Fund jeopardize the Fund's exemption from registration and regulation under the Investment Company Act. Further, it cannot be assured that under certain conditions, changing circumstances or changes in the law, the Fund will not in the future become subject to the Investment Company Act. Becoming subject to the Investment Company Act could have a material adverse effect on the Fund. In addition, because the Fund is currently exempt from registration, the provisions of the Investment Company Act (which, among other matters, require registered investment companies to have disinterested directors, require securities held in custody to at all times be individually segregated from the securities of any other person and marked to clearly identify such securities as the property of such investment company and regulate the relationship between the Investment Adviser and the investment company) will not be applicable.

    The Investment Adviser is not registered as an investment adviser, or included within the registration of an affiliated investment adviser, under the U.S. Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”), in reliance upon the exemption from registration available to managers exclusively of “venture capital funds” as set forth in Rule 203(l)-1 of the Advisers Act. In consequence, the Investment Adviser generally is not subject to certain restrictions, disclosure requirements and other obligations set forth in the Advisers Act that are applicable to registered investment advisers, although the Investment Adviser may become subject to such restrictions, requirements and obligations in the future. The Investment Adviser anticipates that it similarly will be exempt from corresponding restrictions, requirements and obligations arising under other applicable laws.  Ongoing compliance with these exemptions and the Advisers Act requires great care on the part of the General Partner and the Investment Adviser to ensure the Fund’s continuing eligibility for the applicable regulatory regime under the Advisers Act and under other applicable laws. If the Investment Adviser was to fail to qualify for the applicable regulatory regime under the Advisers Act or under any other applicable law, the Fund, the General Partner and the Investment Adviser, as the case may be, could be subject to enforcement action by state or federal securities regulators. Such enforcement action could result in the termination of the Fund's operations and liquidation of the Fund as well as significant fines and penalties.

    In general, each of the General Partner and the Investment Adviser will seek to minimize the degree of governmental regulation and oversight to which the General Partner, the Investment Adviser, the Fund and the Master Partnership are subject. While it is anticipated that this approach will reduce compliance and other costs, this approach will also eliminate a variety of investor protections (including certain protections arising under the Securities Act, the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Investment Company Act, and the Advisers Act) that would be available if the General Partner, the Investment Adviser, the Fund and the Master Partnership were subject to greater governmental regulation and oversight. In particular, prospective investors are cautioned against assuming the applicability of investor protections generally associated with public offerings of securities. This Memorandum is not a “prospectus” or an advertisement, and does not purport to describe or otherwise address all material considerations relating to an investment in the Fund.

    To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the General Partner, the Investment Adviser, the Fund and the Master Partnership (together with their respective related persons) hereby disclaim any duties, obligations, or status as an advisor, finder, agent, broker or dealer on behalf or in respect of any person in connection with such person’s actual or proposed investment in the Fund.

    ***Participation in “New Issues”***.  Pursuant to Rule 5130 and Rule 5131 promulgated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”), “restricted persons” and “covered persons”, respectively, are prohibited from receiving allocations of profit or loss from “new issues”, as defined in such FINRA rules. While Rule 5130 and Rule 5131 provide *de minimis* exemptions from such prohibitions, the Investment Adviser does not intend to limit investment in the Fund by “restricted persons” or “covered persons”. If investment in the Fund by “restricted persons” or “covered persons” exceeds the applicable de minimis thresholds, then the Fund, and therefore all Partners, may be excluded from receiving allocations of profit or loss from “new issues” that are received by the Target Company in which the Fund invests.

    ***Limited Access to Information.*** The rights of Limited Partners to information regarding the Fund and the Target Company will be specified, and strictly limited, in the Fund Agreements. In particular, it is anticipated that the General Partner will obtain certain types of material information that will not be disclosed to Limited Partners. For example, the General Partner may obtain information regarding the Target Company that is material to determining the value of securities issued by the Target Company. Such information may be withheld from Limited Partners in order to comply with duties to the Target Company or otherwise to protect the interests of the Target Company or the Fund.

    Decisions by the General Partner to withhold information may have adverse consequences for Limited Partners in a variety of circumstances. For example: (i) a Limited Partner that seeks to sell its interest in the Fund may have difficulty in determining an appropriate price for such interest; (ii) decisions by the General Partner to withhold information may make it difficult for Limited Partners to subject the General Partner to rigorous oversight; and (iii) each communication from the General Partner to one or more Limited Partners must be interpreted in light of the realistic possibility that the General Partner is in possession of undisclosed information relating to the Fund or the Target Company that could be material to a comprehensive assessment of such communication. Overall, prospective investors should not expect the Fund to be operated with the same degree of “transparency” as a publicly traded corporation.

    ***Exculpation and Indemnification.*** The Fund Agreements will contain provisions that relieve the General Partner, the Investment Adviser, the Administrator and certain other indemnified persons of liability for certain improper acts or omissions. For example, such persons generally will not be liable to the Limited Partners or the Fund for acts or omissions that constitute ordinary negligence. Under certain circumstances, the Fund may even indemnify such persons against liability to third parties resulting from such improper acts or omissions.

    Furthermore, it is expected that each of the General Partner and the Investment Adviser will be structured as a limited liability company and that the individual members of the General Partner and the Investment Adviser, as applicable, generally will not be personally liable for their respective debts and obligations. In consequence, Limited Partners may have little or no recourse to the personal assets of the individual members of the General Partner or the Investment Adviser even if such person breaches a duty to the Limited Partners or to the Fund.

    Notwithstanding any applicable provisions of the Fund Agreements, Limited Partners may have, or be entitled to, rights, claims, causes of action or remedies that cannot be waived or forfeited under applicable law. In particular, Limited Partners should consult with their own legal counsel before concluding that any particular claims against the General Partner, the Investment Adviser or their respective beneficial owners have been waived or forfeited by virtue of the Fund Agreements or otherwise.

    ***Taxation.*** Risks associated with certain tax matters are discussed under “Section IV. Certain Material U.S. Tax Considerations”, which prospective investors should read carefully. Prospective investors are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to their own tax situations and the effects of an investment in the Fund.

    This Memorandum does not contain tax disclosure relating to other potential host countries other than the United States. Moreover, tax laws change on a frequent and unpredictable basis. Prospective investors should assume that host country tax laws will have a significant impact upon the operations and financial performance of the Fund and may even impose direct obligations (such as return filing obligations) upon the Limited Partners.

    ***Legal Counsel.*** Documents relating to the Fund, including the Subscription Agreement to be completed by each investor as well as the Fund Agreements, will be detailed and often technical in nature. Legal counsel to the Fund will represent the interests solely of the General Partner, the Investment Adviser, the Administrator, the Master Partnership and the Fund, and will not represent the interests of any investor or the investors as a group. Moreover, under the Fund Agreements and the Subscription Agreement, each investor will be required to waive any actual or potential conflicts of interest between such investor and legal counsel to the Fund. Accordingly, each investor is urged to consult with its own legal counsel before investing in the Fund or making any other decisions regarding Fund matters.

    In advising as to matters of law (including matters of law described in this Memorandum), legal counsel to the Fund has relied, and will rely, upon representations of fact made by the General Partner, the Investment Adviser and other persons. Such advice may be materially inaccurate or incomplete if any such representations are themselves inaccurate or incomplete. Legal counsel to the Fund generally has not undertaken and will not undertake independent investigation with regard to such representations. Legal counsel’s representation of the General Partner, the Investment Adviser and the Fund is and will be limited to specific matters and will not address all legal or related matters that may be material to the General Partner, the Investment Adviser or the Fund. Moreover, legal counsel has not undertaken to monitor the compliance of the General Partner, the Investment Adviser or the Fund with any laws, regulations, agreements or other matters. It will be the responsibility of each of the General Partner and the Investment Adviser to monitor such compliance and to obtain the advice of counsel as the General Partner or the Investment Adviser, as applicable, deems necessary or appropriate.

    The Fund will generally engage common legal counsel to represent the Fund and its affiliates in a particular transaction, including a transaction in which different funds may have conflicting interests because they are investing in different classes of securities of the same portfolio company. Although separate counsel may be engaged from time to time in the sole discretion of the General Partner, the General Partner believes that the time and cost savings and other efficiencies and advantages of having a common counsel for the funds usually outweigh the disadvantages.

    ***Factual Statements.*** Certain of the factual statements made in this Memorandum are based upon information from various sources believed by the General Partner to be reliable. The General Partner and the Fund have not independently verified any of such information and shall have no liability for any inaccuracy or inadequacy thereof. Except to the extent that legal counsel has been engaged solely to advise as to matters of law, no other party (including legal counsel to the Fund, the General Partner and the Investment Adviser) has been engaged to verify the accuracy or adequacy of any of the factual statements contained in this Memorandum.  In particular, neither legal counsel nor any other party has been engaged to verify any statements relating to the experience, track record, skills, contacts or other attributes of the General Partner or the Investment Adviser or to the anticipated future performance of the Fund.

    ***Definitive Terms and Conditions.*** Portions of this Memorandum describe specific terms and conditions expected to be set forth in the Fund Agreements. The actual terms and conditions set forth in the Fund Agreements may vary materially from those described in this Memorandum for a variety of reasons including negotiations between the General Partner and prospective Limited Partners prior to the Fund’ initial closing as well as formal amendments to the Fund Agreements following such closing. Moreover, the Fund Agreements will contain highly detailed terms and conditions, many of which are not described fully (or at all) in this Memorandum. In all cases, the Fund Agreements will supersede this Memorandum. Prospective investors are urged to carefully review the Fund Agreements, and must also be aware that, pursuant to the rules governing amendments set forth in the Fund Agreements, certain types of amendments to the Fund Agreements may be adopted with the consent of less than all Members.

    ***Industry Specific Terminology.*** Investors are cautioned that certain terms and phrases of common usage within the venture capital/private equity industry may be misleading to those unfamiliar with such usage. In particular, individuals who participate in the management of a fund often are referred to, in a colloquial sense, as “general partners” even though they are not actually general partners of any partnership. Investors are reminded that the Fund will be a series of the Master Partnership, which is organized as a multi-series limited partnership, that the General Partner of the Fund will be a limited liability company as its sole General Partner, and that the individuals directing the management of the Fund through the General Partner will be officers/directors of the General Partner. It is not intended that the Fund will have any general partner or that any actual general partnership will in any manner be associated with the formation, operation, dissolution or termination of the Fund. Prospective investors must not presume or rely upon the existence of any actual legal entities other than the Fund and the General Partner. With respect to all matters involving industry specific terminology, prospective investors are urged to consult with their own legal and other advisors.

    ***Contingent Liabilities on Disposition of Investments.*** In connection with the disposition of an investment in the Target Securities, the Fund may be required to make representations about the business and financial affairs of such company typical of those made in connection with the sale of a business. The Fund may be required to indemnify the purchasers of such investment to the extent that any such representations are inaccurate. These arrangements may result in the incurrence of contingent liabilities for which the General Partner may establish reserves and escrows. In that regard, distributions may be delayed or withheld until such reserve is no longer needed or the escrow period expires. Alternatively, the Limited Partners may be required to return distributions previously made to them to satisfy the Fund’ obligations with respect to the foregoing.

    ***Risk Factors Not Exhaustive.***  The foregoing risk factors are not exhaustive and do not purport to be a complete explanation of all the risks and significant considerations involved in investing in the Fund. In particular, the Fund’s performance may be affected by changes in market or economic conditions or legal, regulatory, and tax requirements. The Fund will be responsible for paying fees and expenses regardless of the level of profitability. Investment in the Fund is designed only for sophisticated investors who are able to withstand the loss of their entire investment in the Fund.

    **THE FOREGOING LIST OF RISK FACTORS DOES NOT PURPORT TO BE AN EXHAUSTIVE ENUMERATION OR EXPLANATION OF THE RISKS INVOLVED IN AN INVESTMENT IN THE INTERESTS. PROSPECTIVE LIMITED PARTNERS SHOULD READ THIS ENTIRE MEMORANDUM AND THE FUND AGREEMENTS AND CONSULT WITH THEIR OWN ADVISERS BEFORE DECIDING WHETHER TO INVEST IN THE INTERESTS.**

    **Certain Potential Conflicts of Interest**

    ***Conflicts of Interest.*** There exist a number of potential conflicts of interest among the Investment Adviser, the Administrator, the General Partner and the Fund. Each of the  Investment Adviser and the Administrator is an affiliate of the General Partner. The Investment Adviser, the Administrator and the General Partner (and their respective affiliates and their members, principals and employees) may form other investment entities and provide investment management and advisory services to client accounts in the future. In addition to managing the Fund’s investments, the General Partner, the Administrator and the Investment Adviser may also provide investment advice, manage client accounts and serve as the investment manager to other clients, including other private investment vehicles similar to the Fund. The General Partner and the Investment Adviser may give advice or take action with respect to such other entities or accounts that differs from the advice given with respect to the Fund. The General Partner and the Investment Adviser will determine the allocation of capital from the Fund to investment strategies and techniques on whatever basis they consider appropriate or desirable in their sole and absolute discretion, regardless of whether such strategy or technique creates a conflict of interest.

    Provisions contained within the Fund Agreements, the Subscription Agreement and the Investment Advisory Agreement that authorize the General Partner or the Investment Adviser to engage in investment, management or other activities outside, or alongside with, the Fund, or to cause the Fund to make investments in respect of which the General Partner or the Investment Adviser has conflicting interests, will override common law and statutory fiduciary duties that would apply in the absence of such provisions. 

    During the Fund’ term, many different types of conflicts of interest may arise, and this Memorandum does not purport to identify all such conflicts. Limited Partners ultimately will be heavily dependent upon the good faith of the General Partner and the Investment Adviser.

    Risks relating to conflicts of interest are not limited to conflicts affecting the General Partner, the Investment Adviser, the Administrator or the individuals managing the Fund. The Limited Partners are expected to have widely differing interests on a variety of tax, regulatory, business, investment profile and other issues. This may, in turn, give rise to a number of risks that the Limited Partners as a group will not act in a manner consistent with the best interests of the Limited Partners as a group or the best interests of the Fund itself. For example, a Limited Partner may decline to provide its consent to a proposed action by the Fund or the General Partner due to goals or incentives that are unique to such Limited Partner and in conflict with the interests of the Fund or other Limited Partners. Furthermore, conflicts of interest among the Limited Partners likely will make it impracticable for the General Partner to manage the affairs of the Fund in a manner that is viewed as optimal by all Limited Partners, and the General Partner will be under no obligation to do so. In general, prospective investors should assume that the General Partner will not take their unique interests into account when managing the Fund’ affairs.

    ***Devotion of Time.***  The General Partner, the Administrator and the Investment Adviser will devote as much of their time and effort to the affairs of the Fund as may, in their judgment, be necessary to accomplish the purposes of the Fund, and they may engage in other activities or ventures, including competing ventures and/or unrelated employment, that result in various conflicts of interest with the Fund. The Fund Agreements specifically provides that the General Partner, the Administrator and the Investment Adviser (and their respective affiliates and their members, principals, and employees) may conduct any other business, including any business within the securities industry. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Investment Adviser (or its affiliates or their members, principals, or employees) may have, make, and maintain investments in its own name or through other entities and may serve as an officer, director, consultant, partner, or stockholder of one or more investment funds, partnerships, securities firms, or advisory firms. It may not always be possible or consistent with the investment objectives of the various persons or entities described above and of the Fund for the same investment positions to be taken or liquidated at the same time or at the same price.

    ***Transactions with Affiliates.***   Certain advisors and other service providers to the Fund (including accountants, administrators, lenders, bankers, brokers, attorneys, consultants and investment or commercial banking firms) may also provide goods or services to, or have business, personal, financial or other relationships with, the General Partner, the Administrator or the Investment Adviser. Such advisors and service providers may be investors in the Fund, affiliates of the General Partner, the Administrator or the Investment Adviser, sources of investment opportunities or commercial counterparties.  

    ***Performance and Other Fees.*** The fact that the General Partner’s compensation is based on the performance of the Fund may create an incentive for the General Partner to cause the Fund to make investments that are more speculative than would be the case in the absence of performance-based compensation. However, this incentive may be tempered somewhat by the fact that losses will reduce the Fund’s performance and thus the General Partner’s compensation. The General Partner or affiliates thereof may also receive fees from portfolio companies of the Fund, a portion of which may be retained by the General Partner or such affiliates.

    ***Legal Representation and Other Experts.***  While the General Partner, the Administrator, the Investment Adviser, the Fund and the Master Partnership have consulted with counsel, accountants and other experts regarding the structure, terms, and operation of the Fund and the Master Partnership, such counsel and other professionals do not represent potential or actual Limited Partners.  Each potential Limited Partner must consult its own legal, tax and financial advisers regarding the desirability and appropriateness of purchasing and owning the Interests.  

    ***Diverse Member Group.*** The Limited Partners may have conflicting investment, tax and other interests with respect to their investments in the Fund. The conflicting interests of individual Limited Partners may relate to or arise from, among other things, the nature of investments made by the Fund, the structuring or the acquisition of investments and the timing of disposition of investments. As a consequence, conflicts of interest may arise in connection with decisions made by the General Partner, including with respect to the nature or structuring of investments, that may be more beneficial for one investor than for another investor, especially with respect to investors’ individual tax situations. In addition, the Fund may make investments which may have a negative impact on, or compete with, related investments made by the Limited Partners in separate transactions. In selecting, structuring and managing investments appropriate for the Fund, the General Partner will consider the investment and tax objectives of the Fund and its Limited Partners as a whole, not the investment, tax or other objectives of any Limited Partner individually. 

    ***Waiver.*** By acquiring the Interests, each Limited Partner will be deemed to have acknowledged the existence of such actual and potential conflicts of interest and to have waived any claim with respect to any liability arising from the existence of any such conflict of interest.

    ***Potential consequences of CFIUS review for the Fund and Limited Partners.*** The Fund and, by extension, the Limited Partners, are subject to significant risk if an investment by the Fund constitutes a “covered transaction.” The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“**CFIUS**”) may review of an investment would involve significant filing fees and legal expenses, which would be borne by the Fund, and would take many months to complete. If CFIUS determines that a covered transaction presents an unresolved risk to national security, it can suggest that the parties enter into an agreement to mitigate national security risk or that they resign from the transaction altogether. In certain cases, CFIUS can recommend that the transaction be conditioned, suspended or blocked. Further, if a covered transaction is not voluntarily filed with CFIUS in advance of closing, CFIUS may request or compel a review of that transaction after closing, and may condition the transaction or force divestiture of the investment. Penalties for failing to make a mandatory CFIUS filing may include civil penalties or legal action by the government. In addition, due to the risk of a particular investment being a “covered transaction,” the Fund may elect to forego or limit certain investment opportunities to avoid the time, expense and uncertainty associated with a CFIUS review. 

    ***Notice to residents of Florida.*** The securities being offered have not been registered with the financial services commission of the Florida Office of Financial Regulation. If sales are made to five or more Florida purchasers, each such sale is voidable by the purchaser within three days after the first tender of consideration is made by such purchaser to the issuer, an agent of the issuer or an escrow agent, or within three days after availability of that privilege is communicated to such purchaser, whichever occurs later. 

    ***Notice to residents of New Hampshire.*** Neither the fact that a registration statement or an application for a license has been filed with the State of New Hampshire nor the fact that a security is effectively registered or a person is licensed in the state of New Hampshire constitutes a finding by the New Hampshire Secretary of State that any document filed under New Hampshire RSA 421-b is true, complete and not misleading. Neither any such fact nor the fact that an exemption or exception is available for a security or a transaction means that the New Hampshire Secretary of State has passed in any way upon the merits or qualifications of, or recommended or given approval to, any person, security, or transaction. It is unlawful to make, or cause to be made, to any prospective purchaser, customer, or client any representation inconsistent with the provisions of this paragraph.

1.	### [clause="tax-considerations"] CERTAIN MATERIAL TAX CONSIDERATIONS

    ***General***

    The following is a brief summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to an investment in the Fund. This summary does not contain a comprehensive discussion of all U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a Limited Partner in view of that Limited Partner’s particular circumstances or (unless otherwise indicated) to certain Limited Partners subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws – such as regulated investment companies, personal holding companies, brokers or dealers in securities, banks and certain other financial institutions, tax-exempt organizations, trusts and insurance companies – nor does it address any state, estate, local, foreign or other tax consequences of an investment in the Fund, except as otherwise provided in this Memorandum. This summary is based on the assumptions that (i) each Limited Partner (and each of its beneficial owners, as necessary under U.S. federal income tax withholding and backup withholding rules) will provide all appropriate certifications to the Fund in a timely fashion to minimize withholding (or backup withholding) on each Limited Partner’s distributive share of the Fund’s gross income and (ii) each Limited Partner will hold its Interest as a capital asset for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Each prospective investor should also note that, except as otherwise provided in this Memorandum, this summary does not address the interaction of U.S. federal tax laws and any income or estate tax treaties between the U.S. and any other jurisdiction.

    For purposes of this discussion, the term “**U.S. person**” generally means any U.S. citizen or resident individual, any corporation, limited liability company or partnership  organized under U.S. law, any estate (other than an estate the income of which, from sources outside the U.S. that is not effectively connected with a trade or business within the U.S., is not includible in its gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes) and any trust if a court within the U.S. is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust. The term “**U.S. Limited Partner**” means any Limited Partner that is a U.S. person and, unless the context otherwise requires, includes any U.S. person that holds an equity Interest through one or more partnerships or other entities treated as transparent for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The term “**Non-U.S. Limited Partner**” means a Limited Partner that is not a U.S. person.

    No assurance can be given that the Internal Revenue Service (the “**IRS**”) will concur with the tax consequences set forth below. Each prospective investor is advised to consult its own tax counsel as to the specific U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Fund and as to applicable foreign, state, estate and local taxes. Also, see the discussion of tax matters under “Certain Investment Considerations and Conflicts of Interest” in Section III. 

    **Prospective investors should confer with their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of investment in the Fund, including the impact of state, local and foreign tax laws, considering the prospective investors’ particular circumstances. The General Partner assumes no responsibility for the tax consequences of this transaction to any investor.**

    ***Federal Income Tax Treatment as a Partnership***

    The Treasury Regulations provide that a partnership will be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes unless it elects to be treated as an association taxable as a corporation or is considered to be a publicly traded partnership. The Fund has no intention of electing to be treated as an association taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. Moreover, the Fund does not intend to participate in or allow any of the activities that would cause the Fund to be treated as a publicly traded partnership within the meaning of the Code and the Treasury Regulations. Accordingly, the Fund believes, and the remainder of this discussion assumes, that the Fund will be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and that each Limited Partner will be treated as a partner for federal income tax purposes.

    Because it will be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, the Fund will file annual income tax information returns but will not be subject as an entity to federal income tax liability. Instead, each Limited Partner will receive an IRS Form 1065, Schedule K-1, showing the Limited Partner’s share of the Fund’s income, gain, loss, deduction and credit for each tax year. Each Limited Partner generally will be required to report, on the Limited Partner’s separate income tax return, that Limited Partner’s share of Fund income, gain, loss, deduction and credit, whether or not any cash or other property is distributed to that Limited Partner by the Fund. In the absence of cash distributions from the Fund, a Limited Partner may have to use funds from other sources to pay taxes with respect to any Fund income or gain that is allocated to that Limited Partner. Similarly, each Limited Partner generally will be able to report its share of losses of the Fund, if any, for tax purposes, subject to certain limitations (discussed below), even if the Limited Partner receives a cash distribution.

    Because the Fund will be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, it will have its own taxable year separate from the taxable years of Limited Partners. Pursuant to Section 706 of the Code, unless a business purpose can be established to support a different taxable year, a partnership generally must use the “*majority interest taxable year,*” which is the taxable year that conforms to the taxable year of the holders of more than fifty percent (50%) of the interests in the partnership. In this case, the majority interest taxable year is expected to be the calendar year, and the Fund does not anticipate that it will seek to use a different taxable year based on its business purpose.

    ***Limited Partners’ Basis in Fund Interests***

    Generally, the initial tax basis of a Limited Partner’s Interest will equal the amount of money paid for that Interest or contributed to the Fund, plus the Limited Partner’s adjusted tax basis in any property contributed to the Fund, less liabilities of the Limited Partner that are assumed by the Fund, plus the Limited Partner’s share of the Fund’s liabilities determined in accordance with the Treasury Regulations under Section 752 of the Code. A Limited Partner’s tax basis in its Interest will be increased by the Limited Partner’s allocable share of Fund taxable income and the amount of any additional contributions to capital. A Limited Partner’s tax basis in its Interest will be decreased (but not below zero) by the Limited Partner’s allocable share of Fund taxable losses and the amount of any distribution to the Limited Partner by the Fund. A Limited Partner may deduct its allocable share of Fund losses only to the extent that those losses do not exceed the Limited Partner’s adjusted tax basis in its Interest. Losses in excess of basis may be carried forward until the Limited Partner’s adjusted tax basis in its Interest is increased above zero.

    ***Allocations of Net Income and Net Losses***

    Net Income and Net Losses will be allocated among Limited Partners in accordance with the Fund Agreements. The General Partner believes that allocations of Net Income and Net Losses contained in the Fund Agreements will be in accordance with the Limited Partners’ Interests in the Fund or will have “*substantial economic effect*” within the meaning of the Treasury Regulations under Section 704 of the Code. Accordingly, the General Partner expects that the allocations contained in the Fund Agreements will be respected by the IRS.

    ***Distributions***

    A Limited Partner generally will be taxed on the income and gain of the Fund that is allocated to the Limited Partner, whether or not any money or other property is distributed to the Limited Partner to pay the resulting federal income tax liability. A cash distribution generally will be treated as a return of capital to the extent of the Limited Partner’s adjusted tax basis in its Interest and will not constitute taxable income to that extent. A Limited Partner’s adjusted tax basis in its Interest will be reduced by the amount of those distributions, and any amounts of money distributed to a Limited Partner in excess of the Limited Partner’s adjusted tax basis in its Interest generally will be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of the Interest. The federal income tax treatment of that gain will be subject to the considerations that are discussed under “Disposition of Fund Interests” below. If the Fund distributes an asset other than money to a Limited Partner, the Limited Partner generally will not recognize any gain or loss until the Limited Partner sells or otherwise disposes of the asset. If the Limited Partner’s adjusted tax basis in its Interest exceeds the Fund’s adjusted tax basis in the asset distributed, the Limited Partner’s initial tax basis in that asset will be the same as the Fund’s adjusted tax basis in the asset immediately before the distribution. If, however, the Limited Partner’s adjusted tax basis in its Interest is less than the Fund’s adjusted tax basis in the asset distributed, the Limited Partner’s initial tax basis in the asset will be the same as the Limited Partner’s adjusted tax basis in its Interest. The Limited Partner’s gain or loss from a subsequent sale or other taxable disposition of an asset will equal the difference, if any, between the amount realized on the sale or other taxable disposition and the Limited Partner’s adjusted tax basis in the asset. The character of that gain (as capital gain or ordinary income) will depend generally on the character of the asset in the hands of the Limited Partner and the character of certain assets inside the Fund. For purposes of determining whether capital gain from a Limited Partner’s sale of an asset will be treated as long-term capital gain or short-term capital gain, the Limited Partner generally may add the Fund’s holding period of the asset to the Limited Partner’s holding period of the asset.

    ***Disposition of Fund Interests***

    In general, a Limited Partner will recognize gain or loss from a sale or other taxable disposition of an Interest in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized on the sale or other taxable disposition and the Limited Partner’s adjusted tax basis in the Interest. If an Interest is held as a capital asset of the Limited Partner, the gain or loss generally will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss, *provided* the Interest was held for more than one (1) year before the date of the sale or other taxable disposition. Some or all of the gain from a sale of an Interest may be characterized as ordinary income regardless of the Limited Partner’s holding period of the Interest, however, to the extent of the Limited Partner’s share of the Fund’s inventory and unrealized receivables.

    ***Unrelated Business Taxable Income***

    Tax-exempt entities and qualified plans, including public charities, private foundations, IRAs and other qualified retirement plans are subject to federal income tax on UBTI. The rates of that tax depend on the nature of the tax-exempt entity or qualified plan. UBTI is defined generally as gross income from any unrelated trade or business, less the allowable deductions that are directly related to the carrying on of the trade or business, with certain statutory modifications.  For purposes of calculating UBTI, a partner in a partnership is considered to be engaged in the trade or business of the partnership. Thus, a Limited Partner will be considered to be engaged in the business of the Fund for UBTI purposes. Whether the trade or business of the Fund will generate UBTI will depend generally on (a) the character of the Interest with respect to each Limited Partner, (b) whether the Fund has net taxable income and (c) the character of items of gross income generated by the Fund.

    As discussed above, a Limited Partner will include in income its distributive share of items of Fund income and losses. A Limited Partner that is a tax-exempt entity or plan must categorize those items under the rules of Section 512 of the Code to determine whether they must be included in computing UBTI. Items of gross income that are generally excluded from UBTI include dividends, interest, and gains or losses from the sale of property held for investment. Items of Fund income that would otherwise be excluded from UBTI, however, will generate UBTI if the income-producing property is considered “*debt-financed property*” within the meaning of Section 514 of the Code. Subject to certain exceptions in the Fund Agreements, the General Partner will use commercially reasonable efforts not to take any action that would cause any Limited Partner subject to Section 511 of the Code to be allocated UBTI under Sections 512 or 514 of the Code.  Thus, it is possible that some of the investments held by the Fund will constitute debt-financed property and will generate UBTI to an investor that is a tax-exempt entity or qualified plan. In addition, if an investor that is a tax-exempt entity or qualified plan borrows money to acquire its Interest, that Interest will be treated as debt-financed property.

    **The foregoing is intended only as a general discussion of UBTI. The UBTI rules are complex, and their application depends in large part on the circumstances of each tax-exempt entity or qualified plan that invests in the Fund. Any tax-exempt entity or qualified plan that is considering an investment in the Fund should consult with its tax advisor regarding the impact of such an investment on UBTI.**

    ***Dissolution and Liquidation of Fund***

    Upon dissolution of the Fund, any remaining assets of the Fund may be sold, which may result in the Fund realizing taxable gain that would be allocated among Limited Partners. Distributions of cash or Fund assets in complete liquidation of the Fund generally will be treated first as a return of capital and thereafter as gain from the sale of an Interest, to the extent of the amount of money and the fair market value (determined as of the date of liquidation) of any assets distributed. Generally, upon liquidation of the Fund, each Limited Partner will recognize gain to the extent that the amount of money and the fair market value (determined as of the date of liquidation) of certain marketable securities distributed exceeds the Limited Partner’s adjusted tax basis in the Interest at the time of distribution. The gain generally will be considered as gain from the sale or exchange of an Interest.

    ***Tax Termination of the Fund***

    If 50% or more of the Interests are sold or exchanged within any 12-month period (excluding successive transfers of the same Interest), the Fund will be treated as having been terminated for federal income tax purposes. Neither the admission of Limited Partners that contribute capital nor the withdrawal of Limited Partners is considered a sale or exchange of an Interest for purposes of this rule. If a termination occurs, the Fund will be treated for federal income tax purposes as having contributed all of its assets and liabilities to a new partnership and, immediately thereafter, as having distributed interests in the new partnership to the purchasing partner and the other remaining partners pro rata. This deemed transaction may have certain adverse federal income tax consequences, such as restarting the depreciation period for some or all of the Fund’s depreciable assets, and possibly “*bunching*” income of Limited Partners whose taxable years differ from the Fund’s taxable year.

    ***Passive Activities***

    Losses generated by “*passive activities*” generally are deductible only to the extent of income generated by passive activities. Generally, any Limited Partner interest in a partnership is treated as an interest in a passive activity for purposes of the passive-activity loss rules. A Limited Partner’s allocable share of all taxable income, gain or loss of the Fund would, under the general rule, be considered passive income, gain or loss.

    ***Returns and Tax Information***

    The Fund will annually furnish to Limited Partners sufficient information for Limited Partners to prepare their own federal and state income tax returns and reports. Schedule K-1 will only be furnished to Limited Partners when there has been taxable activity in the Fund during a tax year. Because the Fund may have years in which there is no activity, there may be years in which investors do not receive K-1 tax documents. Because the Fund cannot provide this information until it has all necessary information with respect to its investments, a Limited Partner may be required to file for tax extensions in order to allow sufficient time for the completion of Fund’s income tax returns. The Fund’s information returns will be prepared by certified public accountants selected by the General Partner.

    ***Tax Reporting by U.S. Investors***

    U.S. tax rules impose information reporting requirements on U.S. persons who own, directly or indirectly under attribution rules, more than certain threshold amounts of stock in a non-U.S. corporation. These persons must disclose, among other things, various transactions between themselves and those non-U.S. corporations. For purposes of these reporting requirements, stock ownership is determined regarding certain stock attribution rules, and each investor is treated as owning part or all of the stock owned by the Fund. Similar reporting requirements apply to U.S. persons who (i) own, directly or indirectly, more than certain threshold amounts of capital interests or profits interests in foreign entities treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such as the Fund or a foreign fund into which the Fund invests; or (ii) contribute, in their capacity as Limited Partners, more than $100,000 to a non-U.S. partnership, such as the Fund or a foreign fund into which the Fund invests, during any 12 month period. In certain circumstances, U.S. investors may be required to file reports annually.

    ***Disclosure of Reportable Transactions***

    A taxpayer who participates in a “*reportable transaction*” generally is required to attach a disclosure schedule to its U.S. federal income tax return disclosing that taxpayer’s participation in the transaction. Subject to various exceptions, reportable transactions include, among other transactions, a transaction that results in a loss exceeding certain thresholds. If the Fund engages in any reportable transactions, certain U.S. investors may have disclosure obligations with respect to their investment in the Fund. Furthermore, a U.S. investor may have a disclosure obligation with respect to its Interest if the investor engages in a reportable transaction with respect to its Interest. Failure to comply with these and other reporting requirements could result in the imposition of significant penalties. U.S. investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the potential applicability of any disclosure requirements to them.

    **The federal income tax aspects of the Fund summarized above are general in nature, and this discussion is not intended to include a complete explanation of the federal income tax results of investing in the Fund. Each prospective investor should consult with its own tax advisor for detailed information.**

    ***State and Local Taxation***

    The foregoing discussion does not address the state and local tax considerations of an investment in the Fund. Each prospective investor should consult with its own tax advisor for detailed information on state and local income tax consequences of making an investment in the Fund.

    ***Foreign Income Tax Considerations for U.S. Investors***

    **Non-U.S. Taxes.** If the Fund investments include investments in foreign portfolio funds and/or investments in a foreign Target Company, the Fund’s income and gains may be subject to withholding, net income or other taxation in foreign jurisdictions where the investments are located. The applicability of those taxes is not addressed in this Memorandum.

    **Foreign Tax Credit Limitations**. With respect to creditable foreign taxes paid on the income or gains of the Fund, U.S. investors may be entitled to claim either a foreign tax credit, or, subject to limits generally applicable to all deductions, a deduction for their share of those foreign taxes. However, the rules for determining eligibility for and limits on foreign tax credits are extremely complex and depend on a number of factors that are unique to each U.S. investor’s particular circumstances. For example, a credit for foreign taxes is subject to the limitation that it may not exceed the U.S. investor’s federal tax (before the credit) attributable to its total foreign source taxable income.

    The availability of foreign tax credits is determined separately for “*passive*” income (generally, interest and dividends) and “*general*” income (generally, non-passive income and certain passive income), so that excess foreign taxes attributable to one category of income may not be used to offset federal tax liability with respect to foreign source income in the other category of income. In addition, foreign taxes may offset federal tax liability only with respect to income that is treated as foreign source income, so that, for example, foreign taxes imposed on any income or gains of the Fund that are treated as U.S. source income for federal income tax purposes will not be eligible to offset the federal taxes imposed on the income or gains and may be credited, if at all, only against foreign taxes imposed on other foreign source income or gains in the same category of income for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes. Furthermore, foreign taxes paid by a foreign corporation in which the Fund holds a direct or indirect equity investment generally cannot be claimed as a credit by a U.S. investor unless the U.S. investor is a corporation that is treated as owning (actually or constructively) at least 10% of the voting stock of the foreign corporation and certain other conditions are satisfied. The rules for determining the classification of the Fund’s income to a U.S. investor will differ depending upon the U.S. investor’s percentage ownership of the Fund and the Fund’s percentage ownership of, and type of ownership in, foreign portfolio funds and foreign a Target Company. Foreign source losses of the Fund may decrease federal taxes on U.S. source income but may also reduce the amount of foreign tax credits otherwise available to Limited Partners, and foreign source losses recognized in one year may result in a re-sourcing of otherwise foreign source income as U.S. source income in a subsequent year, also limiting eligibility for foreign tax credits. Investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding all aspects of the rules applicable to foreign tax credits and the potential availability to them of foreign tax credits with respect to the income or taxes of the Fund.

    ***Non-U.S. Investors***

    As discussed in more detail below, a non-U.S. investor generally should not be subject to taxation by the United States (other than certain withholding taxes) with respect to its investment in the Fund so long as that investor does not spend more than 182 days in the United States during its taxable year, does not otherwise have a substantial connection with the United States, and is not engaged, or deemed to be engaged, in a U.S. trade or business. 

    An investment in the Fund should not, by itself, cause a non-U.S. investor to be engaged in a U.S. trade or business for the foregoing purposes, so long as (i) the Fund is not considered a dealer in stocks, securities or commodities, and does not regularly offer to enter into, assume, offset, assign, or terminate positions in derivatives with customers, (ii) the Fund’s U.S. business activities (if any) consist solely of investing in and/or trading stocks or securities, commodities of a kind customarily dealt in on an organized commodity exchange (if the transaction is of a kind customarily consummated at that place) and derivatives for its own account, and (iii) any entity in which the Fund invests that is treated as a disregarded entity or partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes is not engaged in, or deemed to be engaged in, a U.S. trade or business. The Fund intends to conduct its affairs in a manner that meets those requirements. 

    If notwithstanding the Fund’s intention, the Fund were engaged in, or deemed to be engaged in, a U.S. trade or business, non-U.S. Limited Partners in the Fund would also be deemed to be so engaged by virtue of their ownership of the Interests. In that event, a non-U.S. investor would be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return for that year and pay tax on its income and gain that is effectively connected with that U.S. trade or business at the tax rates applicable to similarly situated U.S. persons. In addition, any non-U.S. investor that is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be required to pay a branch profits tax equal to 30% of the dividend equivalent amount for the taxable year. The Fund would also be required to withhold taxes on any income and gain effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business that is allocable to that non-U.S. investor under Section 1446 of the Code. 

    Even assuming that the Fund is not engaged in, or deemed to be engaged in, a U.S. trade or business, non-U.S. investors will be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax on the gross amount of their allocable share of Fund income that is (i) U.S. source interest income that falls outside the portfolio interest exception or other available exception to withholding tax, (ii) U.S. source dividend income or dividend equivalent payments, and (iii) any other U.S. source fixed or determinable annual or periodical gains, profits, or income.  

    Non-U.S. investors who are resident alien individuals of the United States (generally, individuals lawfully admitted for permanent residence, or who have a substantial presence, in the United States) or for whom their allocable share of Fund income and gain, and the gain realized on the sale or disposition of a Fund interest is otherwise effectively connected with their conduct of a U.S. trade or business will be subject to U.S. federal income taxation on the income and gains.  

    In addition, in the case of a Limited Partner who is non-resident alien individual, any allocable share of capital gains will be subject to a 30% U.S. federal income tax (or lower treaty rate if applicable) if (i) that individual is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year and (ii) that gain is derived from U.S. sources. Although the source of that gain is generally determined by the place of residence of the non-U.S. investors, resulting in that gain being treated as derived from non-U.S. sources, source may be determined with respect to certain other criteria resulting in that gain being treated as derived from U.S. sources. In addition, that gain will be treated as derived from U.S. sources if it is attributable to an office or other fixed place of business in the United States maintained by that non-U.S. investor. For this purpose, an office or other fixed place of business of the Fund will be attributed to that non-U.S. investor. Investors who are non-resident alien individuals should consult their tax advisors with respect to the application of these rules to their investment in the Fund. 

    The Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act requires certain foreign entities to enter into an agreement with the Secretary of the Treasury to disclose to the IRS the name, address and tax identification number of certain U.S. persons who own an interest in the foreign entity and require certain other foreign entities to provide certain other information to avoid a 30% withholding tax on certain payments of U.S. source income and certain payments of proceeds from the sale of property that could give rise to U.S. source interest or dividends. The IRS has released regulations that provide for the phased implementation of the foregoing withholding and reporting requirements. Accordingly, certain non-U.S. investors may be subject to a 30% withholding tax in respect of certain of the Fund’s investments if they fail to enter into an agreement with the Secretary of the Treasury or otherwise fail to satisfy their obligations under the legislation. Non-U.S. investors are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of this legislation on an investment in the Fund.

    **The tax aspects of the Fund summarized above are general in nature, and this discussion is not intended to include a complete explanation of the federal income tax results of investing in the Fund. Each prospective investor should consult with its own tax advisor for detailed information.**

    **To ensure compliance with IRS Circular 230, investors are hereby notified that (i) any discussion of federal tax issues in this Memorandum is not intended or written to be relied on, and cannot be relied on by any investor or any other person, for the purpose of avoiding penalties that may be imposed under the Code; (ii) that discussion is written to support the promotion or marketing (within the meaning of IRS Circular 230) of the transactions or matters addressed herein; and (iii) each investor should seek advice based on the investor’s particular circumstances from an independent tax advisor.**

1.	### [clause="legal-and-regulatory-considerations"] CERTAIN LEGAL AND REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS

    ***Suitability Standards***

    An investment in the Fund involves significant risks and is suitable only for persons of adequate financial means who have no need for liquidity, and can bear the risk of a complete loss, with respect to an investment in the Fund. There is no public market for interests in the Fund and it is not expected that a public market will develop. There are substantial restrictions on the ability of a Limited Partner to withdraw capital or to transfer its interest in the Fund. See “Certain Investment Considerations and Conflicts of Interest” and “Summary of Principal Terms.”

    In connection with its investment in the Fund, each investor will be required to make a variety of representations in order to establish its suitability for investing in the Fund, including: (a) that the investor has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that it (alone or together with its professional advisors) is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of acquiring a Fund interest and of making an informed investment decision with respect thereto; and (b) that the investor has completed to its full satisfaction all investigation, diligence, analysis and consultation with its professional advisors that it has deemed necessary or desirable in connection with its evaluation of a Fund interest.

    With respect to Fund interests offered and sold within the United States, each investor will generally be required to represent that the investor is an “accredited investor” within the meaning of Regulation D under the United States Securities Act. With respect to Fund interests offered and sold outside the United States, investors may be required to make similar representations to establish their suitability under non-United States laws.

    In connection with its investment in the Fund, each investor will also be required to complete a questionnaire to: (a) further establish its suitability for investing in the Fund, (b) ensure that the Fund and the General Partner can comply with applicable laws, including the United States Securities Act, the United States Investment Company Act and the United States Investment Advisors Act, and (c) report certain information about the investor to the General Partner.  Failure to accurately complete such questionnaire may result in a Fund investor being required to withdraw from the Fund.

    ***U.S. Securities Act of 1933***

    The Interests have not been registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any U.S. state or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and, therefore, cannot be resold unless they are subsequently registered under the Securities Act and other applicable securities laws or unless an exemption from registration is available.  The Interests will be offered and sold under the exemption provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, Rule 506 of Regulation D and Regulation S promulgated thereunder and other exemptions of similar import in the laws of the states and jurisdictions where the offering will be made.  Within the United States, this offering of Class A Interests is made as a private placement pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, and only to parties that are “accredited investors” as defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act.  Outside of the United States, this offering of Class B Interests is made pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act, only to parties that are not “U.S. persons” as defined in such regulation, and pursuant to exemptions from applicable Non-U.S. Securities Laws.  The Interests will not be registered under any other securities laws, including state securities laws or blue sky laws and Non-U.S. Securities Laws.  It is not contemplated that registration of the Interests under the Securities Act or other securities laws will ever be effected.  There is no public market for the Interests, and one is not expected to develop.

    ***U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940***

    The Fund has not been, and will not be, registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act in reliance upon Section 3(c)(1) thereof, which excludes from the definition of “investment company” any issuer whose outstanding securities are beneficially owned by not more than 100 persons, as such term is defined in Section 3(c)(1), and that meets the other conditions contained therein; provided, however, that if issuer is a “qualifying venture capital fund” as such term is defined in Section 3(c)(1), such issuer is excluded from the definition of “investment company” if its outstanding securities are beneficially owned by not more than 250 persons.  Consequently, investors will not be afforded the protections of the Investment Company Act.

    ***U.S. Investment Advisers Act of 1940***

    Neither the General Partner nor the Management Company is currently registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. The Advisers Act and rules promulgated thereunder provide for exemptions from registration under the Advisers Act on which the General Partner and the Management Company will rely upon to the extent they are able to meet the requirements of such exemption rules but there is no assurance that they will be able to comply with such requirements.  As long as the General Partner and the Management Company remain exempt, Limited Partners will not be afforded the full protections under the Advisers Act that would apply if the General Partner or the Management Company were to register as an investment adviser with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Even if the Management Company and the General Partner can comply with exemptions to registration, the General Partner and/or the Management Company will still be required to comply with the reporting, record-keeping and other compliance requirements applicable to exempt advisers.

    ***Anti-Money Laundering Laws and Economic Sanctions***

    All subscriptions for the Interests are subject to applicable anti-money laundering laws and economic sanctions. Investors will be required to provide information that, in the judgment of the Fund, is reasonably necessary to facilitate compliance with any applicable anti-money laundering laws, including 18 U.S.C. 1956, 1957 (prohibiting money laundering) and 31 USC 5311-32 (the Bank Secrecy Act), as implemented via 31 CFR Chapter X, and with applicable economic sanctions, including 31 CFR Chapter V.  

    Further, each investor must represent, among other things, in its Subscription Agreement with the Fund that neither the investor, nor any person having a direct or indirect beneficial interest in the limited partnership interest being acquired by the investor, appears on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List of the Office of Foreign Assets Control in the United States Department of the Treasury and that the investor does not know or have any reason to suspect that (i) the money used to fund the investor’s investment in the Fund has been or will be derived from or related to any illegal activities or (ii) the proceeds from the investor’s investment in the Fund will be used to finance any illegal activities.

    The Fund will seek to: verify the identity of a prospective investor; ensure that the prospective investor is not named on one of the prohibited lists maintained by the U.S. Treasury Department or is otherwise subject to U.S. economic sanctions; and verify the source of a prospective investor’s funds. Once a prospective investor becomes a limited partner, the Fund may monitor communications, capital contributions and withdrawals, and other payments involving the limited partner; and report suspicious activity to appropriate authorities U.S. anti-money laundering laws and economic sanctions change frequently, and the Fund may be required to implement other compliance measures from time to time. 

    The Fund reserves the right to request such information as is necessary to verify the identity of a prospective investor. The Fund also reserves the right to request such identification evidence in respect of a transferee of the Interests.  In the event of delay, failure to provide requested information, or on the basis of the information provided by the prospective investor or transferee, the Fund may refuse to accept the application or (as the case may be) to give effect to the relevant transfer and (in the case of a subscription for the Interests) any funds received will be returned without interest to the account from which the monies were originally debited.

    The Fund also reserves the right to refuse to make any distribution to a Limited Partner, if the General Partner suspects or is advised that the payment of any distribution proceeds to such Limited Partner might result in a breach or violation of any applicable anti-money laundering laws or economic sanctions or other laws or regulations by any person in any relevant jurisdiction, or such refusal is considered necessary or appropriate to ensure the compliance by the Fund or the General Partner with any such laws or regulations in any relevant jurisdiction.

    The General Partner may be required to provide this information, or report the failure to comply with requests for such information, to appropriate governmental authorities, in certain circumstances without notifying the investors that the information has been provided. Each of the General Partner and the Fund will take such steps as it determines in their sole discretion are necessary to comply with applicable law, regulations, orders, directives or special measures.  These steps may include prohibiting an investor from making further contributions of capital to the Fund, depositing distributions or other funds or assets to which an investor would otherwise be entitled to in an escrow account or causing the exclusion of an investor from the Fund. The Fund will not admit an investor without obtaining all information that the Fund determines is required. By subscribing for the Interests, investors consent to the disclosure by the Fund and the General Partner of any information about them to regulators and others upon request in connection with money laundering, economic sanctions, and similar matters in relevant jurisdictions.

    ***Data Protection***

    Prospective investors should note that personal data must be supplied in order for an investment in the Partnership to be made and for that investment in the Partnership to continue. Certain personal data must be supplied to enable the investment to be redeemed. If the required personal data is not provided, then a prospective investor will not be able to invest or continue to invest in the Partnership.

    The Partnership’s use of personal data is governed by the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 in respect of California data subjects and the EU General Data Protection Regulation in respect of EU data subjects (together, the “Data Protection Legislation”).

    Under the Data Protection Legislation, individual data subjects have rights and the Partnership as data controller has obligations with respect to the processing of personal data by the Partnership and its affiliates and delegates, including but not limited to the Administrator. Breach of the Data Protection Legislation by the Partnership could lead to enforcement action. The Partnership’s privacy notice provides information on the Partnership’s use of personal data under the Data Protection Legislation. The Partnership’s privacy notice is contained in the Subscription Agreement and is made available to existing investors via routine investor communications.
