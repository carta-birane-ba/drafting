1. The execution and delivery of and/or adherence to, as applicable, this Subscription Agreement, the Subscriber Information Form and the Partnership Agreement by or on behalf of the Subscriber, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and the performance of the Subscriber’s obligations under this Subscription Agreement and the Partnership Agreement will not conflict with, or result in any violation of or default under, any provision of any governing instrument applicable to the Subscriber, or any agreement or other instrument to which the Subscriber is a party or by which the Subscriber or any of its properties are bound, or any United States or non-United States permit, franchise, judgment, decree, statute, order, rule or regulation applicable to the Subscriber or the Subscriber’s business or properties.
1. The Subscriber (or its authorized representative) has examined the Partnership Agreement and recognizes that the Partnership has very little material or no operating history. The Subscriber acknowledges that (i) an investment in the Partnership involves a high degree of risk and is suitable only for investors of substantial financial means who have no immediate need for liquidity of the amount invested and who can afford a risk of loss of all or a substantial part of such investment; (ii) the Subscriber has carefully read and understands the risks and conflicts of interest disclosed in Appendix A; (iii) there can be no assurance that the Partnership’s investment(s) will be profitable, or that the Subscriber will receive a return of his, her or its investment; (iv) the Subscriber has had the opportunity to consult with his, her or its personal legal, tax and financial advisors and has considered and evaluated the risks and conflicts of interest, before making an investment in the Partnership; and (v) the Subscriber has the necessary knowledge and experience in financial and business matters to enable it to evaluate the merits and risks of a purchase of an Interest and believes that an investment in the Partnership is suitable and appropriate for the Subscriber.
1. The Subscriber agrees that the Subscriber’s representations, agreements, acknowledgments and understandings are all continuous and that all further subscriptions for an additional Interest will be governed by them, and the act of making any subscriptions for an additional Interest will be evidence of the Subscriber’s reaffirmation of such representations, agreements, acknowledgments and understandings. The Subscriber further agrees to advise the General Partner promptly of any changes to any such representations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Subscriber agrees to execute any necessary re-affirmation or re-certifications of any of the representations contained herein that the General Partner may request.

1. The Subscriber confirms that it is not subscribing for the Interest as a result of any form of general solicitation or general advertising, including (i) any advertisement, article, notice or other communications published in any newspaper, magazine or similar media (including any Internet site that is not password protected) or broadcast over television or radio or (ii) any seminar or meeting whose attendees were invited by any general solicitation or general advertising.

1. If the Subscriber is a partnership, a limited liability company treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes, a grantor trust (within the meaning of Sections 671-679 of the Code) or an S-corporation (within the meaning of Code Section 1361) (each, a “flow-through entity”), the Subscriber represents and warrants that either:

    - no person or entity will own, directly or indirectly through one or more flow-through entities, an interest in the Subscriber such that more than 70% of the value of such person’s or entity’s interest in the Subscriber is attributable to the Subscriber’s investment in the Partnership; or

    - if one or more persons or entities will own, directly or indirectly through one or more flow-through entities, an interest in the Subscriber such that more than 70% of the value of such person’s or entity’s interest in the Subscriber is attributable to the Subscriber’s investment in the Partnership, neither the Subscriber nor any such person or entity has or had any intent or purpose to cause such person (or persons) or entity (or entities) to invest in the Partnership indirectly through the Subscriber in order to enable the Partnership to qualify for the 100-partner safe harbor under U.S. Department of Treasury Reg. §1.7704-l(h).

1. The Subscriber represents and warrants that, except as disclosed by the Subscriber to the General Partner in the Subscriber Information Form, the Subscriber is not (i) an “employee benefit plan” that is subject to Title I of the United States Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“<u>ERISA</u>”), (ii) an individual retirement account or annuity or other “plan” that is subject to Code §4975, or (iii) a fund of funds, an insurance company separate account or an insurance company general account or another entity or account (such as a group trust), in each case whose underlying assets are deemed under the U.S. Department of Labor regulation codified at 29 C.F.R. § 2510.3-101, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA (the “<u>Plan Asset Regulation</u>”), to include “plan assets” of any “employee benefit plan” subject to ERISA or “plan” subject to Code §4975 (each of (i) through (iii), a “<u>Benefit Plan Investor</u>”). If the Subscriber has indicated in the Subscriber Information Form that it is not a Benefit Plan Investor, it represents, warrants and covenants that it shall not become a Benefit Plan Investor for so long as it holds Interests.
1. The Subscriber acknowledges that under the terms of the Partnership Agreement, withdrawals from the Partnership are generally not permitted.
1. The Subscriber acknowledges that the General Partner has the right, in its absolute discretion, to reject the admission to the Partnership of any prospective investor, or withdraw the Interest of any investor, including, without limitation, the admission or continuation of a person who would cause (i) the Partnership to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, (ii) the Partnership’s Interest to be required to be registered under the Securities Act, or (iii) the Partnership’s assets to be deemed to be “plan assets” for purposes of ERISA.

1. The Subscriber will not permit any other person to have any beneficial interest in its Interest. The Subscriber agrees not to transfer all or any portion of its Interest except with the prior written consent of the General Partner. If the Interest purchased under this Subscription Agreement is being acquired by the Subscriber as nominee or custodian for another person or entity, the Subscriber will not permit the beneficial owners of such Interest to transfer any beneficial interest in the Interest, directly or indirectly, to any person or entity unless the representations made by the Subscriber in this Subscription Agreement will continue to be true. The Subscriber also agrees to notify the General Partner at its address given above if the Subscriber changes its citizenship or residence, and the Subscriber understands that the General Partner may cause the Subscriber to be withdrawn from the Partnership for any reason, including if the Subscriber is no longer an eligible investor or to avoid adverse tax or regulatory consequences to the Partnership or its other Limited Partners. The Subscriber will supply the General Partner with such other facts as the General Partner shall from time to time decide shall be necessary or desirable in order to avoid the loss of a contemplated tax benefit to the Partnership or any of its Partners and in order to ascertain that no violation by the Partnership shall occur of any securities laws of the United States or any other relevant jurisdiction, including the Securities Act, the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “<u>Advisers Act</u>”).

1. The Subscriber (or its authorized representative) understands that the General Partner may, on behalf of the Partnership, open, conduct and close accounts with brokers and dealers, and may pay commissions, fees and other charges applicable to transactions with respect to such accounts which, subject to applicable law, may not be the lowest available charges.

1. If the Subscriber is not a United States Person, as defined in the Subscriber Information Form, (i) the Subscriber has consulted, or has had the opportunity to consult, with the Subscriber’s own legal counsel to determine whether the Subscriber’s purchase of an Interest is lawful in the Subscriber’s country of citizenship and residence; (ii) the Subscriber acknowledges that (A) it is the Subscriber’s responsibility to understand and comply with all applicable laws in the Subscriber’s country of citizenship and residence that are related to the offer and sale of an Interest in such jurisdiction, and (B) neither the Partnership nor the General Partner has taken any action in any jurisdiction that would permit the offering of Interests, or possession or distribution of offering materials related to the Interests, in any jurisdiction where action for that purpose is required; and (iii) the Subscriber has consulted, or has had the opportunity to consult, with the Subscriber’s own tax advisors to determine the United States tax consequences (including any United States tax return filing obligations) of investing in the Partnership.

<center>####Risk Factors and Conflicts of Interest</center>

<i>An investment in the Partnership involves a high degree of risk and is suitable only for investors of substantial means who have no immediate need for liquidity of the amount invested and who can afford a risk of loss of all or a substantial part of such investment. There can be no assurance that the Partnership’s investment objectives will be achieved, or that a limited partner of the Partnership (“<u>Limited Partner</u>”) will receive a return of its capital contributions. Each prospective investor should consult with his, her or its personal legal, tax and financial advisers and carefully consider and evaluate the risks before making an investment in the Partnership. Investors may be subject to a number of risks, only some of which are set forth below.</i>
###Investment Risks <sup>1</sup>
<u>Investments in Private Companies</u>
<i>Risk Inherent in Private Company Investments.</i> The Partnership may invest in a privately held, early-stage company. The type of investment that the Partnership anticipates making in an early stage private company involves a high degree of risk. In general, financial and operating risks confronting early stage private companies can be significant. A loss of a Limited Partner’s entire capital contribution is possible. The timing of profit realization is highly uncertain. Losses are likely to occur early in the Partnership’s life, while successes often require a long period of time for an investment to mature.
<i>Early-Stage Investments.</i> Privately held, early-stage companies may have little or no revenues and may or may not be profitable. They may require considerable additional capital to develop technologies and markets, acquire customers and achieve or maintain a competitive position. This capital may not be available at all or, if available, only available on unfavorable terms. Further, the technologies and markets of such companies may not develop as anticipated, even after substantial expenditures of capital. Such companies may face intense competition, including competition from established companies with much greater financial resources, more extensive development, manufacturing, marketing and service capabilities, and a greater number of qualified managerial and technical personnel. These companies may have substantial variations in operating results from period to period and experience failures or substantial declines in value at any stage.

<hr>
<sup>1</sup> The risks related to an investment in the Partnership will depend on the type of investment made by the Partnership. Certain of the following risks may or may not apply based on the Partnership’s investment.  The following list of risk factors does not purport to be a complete enumeration or explanation of the risks involved with an investment in the Partnership.
[new-page]
<i>Availability of Investment Capital</i>. Early-stage investments in a private company often require several rounds of capital infusions before the company reaches maturity. Even if the Partnership maintains sufficient liquidity to allow it to participate in follow-on rounds of financings, the Partnership does not intend to provide all necessary follow-on financing and may not provide any follow-on financing. Accordingly, third-party sources of financing will be required. There is no assurance that such additional sources of financing will be available, or, if available, will be on terms beneficial to the Partnership. Furthermore, the Partnership’s capital is limited and may not be adequate to protect the Partnership from dilution in multiple rounds of an early stage private company financing.
<i>Lack of Liquidity</i>. The marketability and value of a private company investment will depend upon many factors beyond the Partnership’s control. Generally, the private company investment made by the Partnership will be illiquid and difficult to value, and there will be little or no collateral to protect an investment once made. At the time of the Partnership’s investment, a private company may lack one (1) or more key attributes (e.g., proven technology, marketable product, complete management team, or strategic alliances) necessary for success. There may be no readily available market for the Partnership’s investment, which will likely be difficult to value, and the disposal of an investment in a private company by the Partnership may be prohibited or delayed many years from the date of initial investment for legal and/or regulatory reasons. The public market for emerging growth companies is volatile and over the last several months has been extremely volatile. Such volatility may adversely affect the development of private companies, the ability of the Partnership to dispose of its investment and the value of investment securities on the date of sale or distribution by the Partnership.
<i>Non-Controlling Investments</i>. To the extent that the Partnership makes an investment in a private company, the Partnership generally will hold non-controlling interests in the private company and, therefore, may have a limited ability to protect its position in the private company. However, as a condition to an investment in a private company, it is expected that appropriate rights generally will be sought to protect the Partnership’s interests to the extent possible. There can be no assurance that such minority investor rights will be available to the Partnership.
<i>Competition for Investment</i>. The Partnership will likely need to compete with other entities if it makes an investment in a private company.  Such competition may come from groups such as institutional investors and other investment funds that have greater resources than the Partnership. The competition may be intense, and such competition may result in less favorable investment terms than would otherwise be the case.
<u>Investments in Digital Assets</u>
The Partnership may invest in cryptocurrencies, decentralized application tokens and protocol tokens, blockchain-based assets and other cryptofinance and digital assets, or instruments for the purchase of such, whether issued in a private or public transaction (“<u>Digital Assets</u>”).  Digital Assets are loosely regulated and there is no central marketplace for currency exchange. Supply is typically determined by a computer code, not by a central bank, and prices can be extremely volatile. Digital Assets exchanges have been closed due to fraud, failure or security breaches. Any of the Partnership’s funds that reside on an exchange that shuts down would likely be lost.

Several factors may affect the price of Digital Assets, including, but not limited to supply and demand, investors’ expectations with respect to the rate of inflation, interest rates, currency exchange rates or future regulatory measures (if any) that restrict the trading of Digital Assets or the use of Digital Assets as a form of payment. There is no assurance that Digital Assets will maintain their long-term value in terms of purchasing power in the future, or that acceptance of Digital Assets payments by mainstream retail merchants and commercial businesses will grow.

Digital Assets are created, issued, transmitted, and stored according to protocols run by computers in the Digital Assets network. It is possible these protocols have undiscovered flaws which could result in the loss of some or all assets held by the Partnership. There may also be network scale attacks against these protocols which result in the loss of some or all of assets held by the Partnership. Some assets held by the Partnership may be created, issued, or transmitted using experimental cryptography which could have underlying flaws. Advancements in quantum computing could break the cryptographic rules of protocols which support the assets held by the Partnership. 
Regulation of Digital Assets in the United States is expected to increase over the next several years.  Regulatory changes with respect to Digital Assets may adversely affect the Partnership, the Partnership’s investment and/or the Limited Partners.
<u>Investments in an SPV or Fund</u>

The Partnership may invest in a third party managed special purpose vehicle or private investment Fund (“<u>Underlying Fund</u>”).  The Partnership will not have an active role in the day-to-day management of the Underlying Fund. Moreover, the Partnership may not have the opportunity to evaluate the specific investments made by the Underlying Fund. Accordingly, the returns of the Partnership will primarily depend on the performance and recommendations of the Underlying Fund’s manager and/or general partner and could be materially and adversely affected by the unfavorable performance of the Underlying Fund’s manager and/or general partner.
If the Partnership invests in an Underlying Fund, the Partnership will not have custody of the Underlying Fund’s assets. Therefore, there is the risk that the Underlying Fund or its custodian could divert or abscond with those assets, fail to follow agreed upon investment strategies, provide false reports of operations or engage in other misconduct. Moreover, there can be no assurances that the Underlying Fund will be operated in accordance with all applicable laws and that assets entrusted to the Underlying Fund will be protected.

In the past there have been a number of widely reported instances of violations of the securities laws by the managers and/or general partners of Underlying Funds through the misuse of confidential information, misappropriation of assets or other activities. Such violations may result in substantial liabilities for damages caused to others, for the disgorgement of profits realized and for penalties. If the Underlying Fund or its manager and/or general partner commits any such violation, the Partnership could be exposed to significant losses.

The Partnership may be subject to management fees charged by an Underlying Fund and carried interest allocated to the Underlying Fund’s general partner or manager.  Accordingly, Limited Partners would potentially be bearing two levels of management fees (i.e., any management fee charged by the Partnership and any management fee charged by the Underlying Fund) and two levels of carried interest (i.e., carried interest payable to the Partnership’s general partner and carried interest payable to the Underlying Fund’s general partner or manager).

<u>General Investment Risks</u>
<i>Terrorist Action</i>. There is a risk of terrorist attacks on the United States and elsewhere causing significant loss of life and property damage and disruptions in global markets. Economic and diplomatic sanctions may be in place or imposed on certain states and military action may be commenced. The impact of such events is unclear, but could have a material effect on general economic conditions and market liquidity.
<i>Global Health Risk</i>. There is a risk that disease, illness, pandemic, and other health risk could impact the United States and elsewhere causing significant loss of life, supply chain disruption, sales disruption, market loss, recession, economic collapse, interest rate change and general disruptions in global markets. These could include issues like SARS, MERS, COVID-19 and others. These could impact the Partnership’s investment. The impact of such events is unclear, but could have a material effect on general economic conditions and market liquidity.
<i>Economic Conditions</i>.  Changes in global economic conditions, including without limitation, interest rates, inflation, employment conditions, competition, political and diplomatic events and trends, tax laws and innumerable other factors, can affect substantially and adversely the Partnership’s investment.  
<u>Partnership Risks</u>
<i>Dependence on the Principal(s)</i>.  The Limited Partners will be relying on the expertise of the principal(s) (“<u>Principal(s)</u>”) of the general partner of the Partnership (“<u>General Partner</u>”) and/or the General Partner’s affiliate(s) in identifying, acquiring, administering and disposing of the Partnership’s investment. Past investment performance by the principal(s) provides no assurance of future results. The loss of the principal(s) could have a material, adverse effect on the Partnership’s investment. 
<i>Long-Term and Illiquid Investment</i>. An investment in the Partnership is a long-term commitment. The interests in the Partnership (the “<u>Interests</u>”) are highly illiquid. Voluntary withdrawals by a Limited Partner are not permitted, except in limited instances when required or when necessary to comply with the laws or regulations applicable to a Limited Partner or the Partnership. Furthermore, the transfer of Interests is subject to approval of the General Partner and other restrictions contained in the Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement of the Partnership (as amended and/or restated, the “<u>Partnership Agreement</u>”). Consequently, Limited Partners may not be able to liquidate an investment in the event of an emergency or for any other reason. An investment in the Partnership is suitable only for persons and entities which have no need for liquidity with respect to their investment. The Interests have not been registered under the Securities Act, nor is any such registration contemplated.
<i>Side Letter Agreements</i>. The General Partner, on behalf of the Partnership, may enter into separate agreements with certain investors in its discretion to allow such investors to invest on different terms than those specifically described in the Partnership Agreement, including, without limitation, the calculation of “carried interest” and the management fee, if any, or depth of information provided to such investors concerning the Partnership. Such information may provide the recipient greater insights into the Partnership’s activities than is included in the standard reports to the Limited Partners. Limited Partners subject to reduced or no management fees, if any, or carried interest may experience substantially greater performance from their investment in the Partnership than will other Limited Partners. The Partnership Agreement does not require the General Partner to notify any or all of the other Limited Partners of any such agreements, nor require the General Partner to offer such additional or different rights to any or all of the other Limited Partners. The other Limited Partners will have no recourse against the Partnership, the General Partner or any of their affiliates in the event that certain Limited Partners receive additional or different rights as a result of such agreements.
<i>Cybersecurity Risk</i>. As part of its business, the General Partner and/or the General Partner’s affiliate(s) process, store and transmit large amounts of electronic information, including information relating to the transactions of the Partnership and personally identifiable information of the Limited Partners. Similarly, service providers of the General Partner, its affiliate(s) or the Partnership, especially the fund administrator, may process, store and transmit such information. The General Partner and/or its affiliate(s) have procedures and systems in place to protect such information and prevent data loss and security breaches. However, such measures cannot provide absolute security. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. Hardware or software acquired from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. Network-connected services provided by third parties to the General Partner and/or its affiliate(s) may be susceptible to compromise, leading to a breach of the General Partner and/or its affiliate(s)’ network. The General Partner and/or its affiliate(s)’ systems or facilities may be susceptible to employee error or malfeasance, government surveillance, or other security threats. Breach of the General Partner and/or its affiliate(s)’ information systems may cause information relating to the transactions of the Partnership and personally identifiable information of the Limited Partners to be lost or improperly accessed, used or disclosed. 
The service providers of the General Partner, its affiliate(s) and the Partnership are subject to the same electronic information security threats as the General Partner and/or its affiliate(s). In the event of a breach of a service provider’s networks, information relating to the transactions of the Partnership and personally identifiable information of the Limited Partners may be lost or improperly accessed, used or disclosed.
The loss or improper access, use or disclosure of the General Partner, its affiliate(s) and/or the Partnership’s proprietary information may cause the General Partner, its affiliate(s) and/or the Partnership to suffer, among other things, financial loss, the disruption of its business, liability to third parties, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. Any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on the Partnership and the Limited Partners’ investments therein.
<u>Legal, Tax and Regulatory Risks</u>
<i>Legal, Tax and Regulatory Risks</i>. Legal, tax, and regulatory changes could occur during the term of the Partnership that may adversely affect the Partnership, the Partnership’s investment and/or the Limited Partners. For example, changes in tax laws and regulations, including those applicable to taxation of carried interest, may result in certain types of investments and/or investment returns being treated differently and accordingly may influence the General Partner’s decisions as to how to best structure the investment profiles of the Partnership.
<i>Regulatory Considerations</i>. While the Partnership may be considered similar in some ways to an investment company, it is not required and does not intend to register as such under the Investment Company Act and, accordingly, the Limited Partners are not accorded with protections of the Investment Company Act. The General Partner and/or its affiliate(s) are not registered as investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “<u>Advisers Act</u>”), or any state law and do not intend to register as such. Accordingly, the Partnership and the Limited Partners will not be subject to the protections of the Advisers Act in so far as it relates to registered investment advisers. The General Partner and/or its affiliate(s) intend to rely on exemptions from registration under the Advisers Act or state law.
<i>Tax Information</i>. The Partnership may not be able to provide final annual tax information to the Limited Partners for any given fiscal year until after April 15 of the following year. The General Partner will use its reasonable efforts to provide the Limited Partners with annual tax information on or before such date, but final annual tax information will not be available until the Partnership has received tax-reporting information from its investment necessary to prepare final annual tax information. The Limited Partners should plan to obtain extensions of the filing dates for their U.S. federal, state and local income tax returns. Each prospective Limited Partner should consult with its own adviser as to the advisability and tax consequences of an investment in the Partnership.
<i>Phantom Income</i>.  Each Limited Partner will be liable for taxes on its allocable share of Partnership income regardless of whether the Partnership has made any distributions to the Limited Partners.  Thus, it is possible that a Limited Partner’s income tax liability in any particular fiscal year attributable to Partnership income will exceed the cash distributed to the Limited Partner by the Partnership.  Each prospective Limited Partner should consult with its own adviser as to the advisability and tax consequences of an investment in the Partnership.
<u>Conflicts of Interest</u>
<i>The Principal(s), the General Partner and/or its affiliate(s) engage, or may engage, in a broad range of activities, including investment activities for their own account. In the ordinary course of conducting its activities, the interests of the Partnership may conflict with the interests of the Principal(s), the General Partner and/or its affiliate(s). A description of certain of these potential conflicts of interest is provided below. The discussion below does not necessarily describe all conflicts that may arise. Any references to the Principal(s), the General Partner and/or its affiliate(s), will be deemed to include their respective affiliates, partners, members, shareholders, officers, directors and employees, as applicable.</i>  
<i>Management of the Partnership; Devotion of Time</i>. Except as otherwise provided in the Partnership Agreement, the Principal(s), the General Partner and/or its affiliate(s) will devote only such portion of their time to the affairs of the Partnership as they consider appropriate in their respective judgment to manage effectively the affairs of the Partnership. Other activities of the Principal(s), the General Partner and/or its affiliate(s) with which they are associated, or with which they may become associated in the future, may require them to devote substantial amounts of their time to matters unrelated to the business of the Partnership.
<i>Other Activities</i>.  The Principal(s), the General Partner and/or its affiliate(s) may work on projects for themselves or other clients that do not relate to the Partnership. The Principal(s), the General Partner and/or its affiliate(s) may, through other investments, including other investment funds, have interests in the investment in which the Partnership invests as well as interests in investments in which the Partnership does not invest, including but not limited to investments that were reviewed by or for the Partnership but in which the Partnership did not invest. Conflicts of interest may arise in allocating investment opportunities, management time, services or functions of the Principal(s), the General Partner and/or its affiliate(s) between and among the Partnership and other activities, clients and/or entities. In addition, the Principal(s), the General Partner and/or its affiliate(s) may have a greater financial interest in activities, clients and/or entities that are unrelated to the Partnership.
<i>Allocation of Investment Opportunities</i>. The General Partner and/or its affiliate(s) may, now or in the future, manage the investments of other funds, which invest in assets eligible for purchase by the Partnership, including any other funds that invest on a parallel basis or coinvest with the Partnership (collectively, the “<u>Other Funds</u>”). The investment objective, strategies and policies, fee arrangements and other circumstances of the Partnership may vary from those of Other Funds. The General Partner and/or its affiliate(s) may, from time to time, be presented with investment opportunities that fall within the investment objectives of the Partnership and Other Funds, and in such circumstances the General Partner and/or its affiliate(s) expects to allocate such opportunities among the Partnership and such Other Funds on a basis that the General Partner and/or its affiliate(s) determines in good faith is appropriate taking into consideration such factors as the General Partner and/or its affiliate(s) determines, including but not limited to the capital available to the Partnership and such Other Funds, any restrictions on investment, the sourcing of the transaction and the size of the transaction, the relation of such opportunity to the investment strategy of the Partnership and such Other Funds, reasons of portfolio balance, the nature and extent of involvement in the transaction on the part of the respective teams of investment professionals for the Partnership and each such Other Fund, potential conflicts of interest, including whether the Partnership or such Other Fund has an existing investment in the opportunity in question, tax, legal or regulatory considerations and other considerations deemed relevant by the General Partner and/or its affiliate(s).  The General Partner and/or its affiliate(s)’ investment decision with respect to the Partnership may differ from the General Partner and/or its affiliate(s)’ investment decision with respect to any Other Fund.
<i>Investor Due Diligence Information</i>. Due in part to the fact that potential investors in the Partnership may ask different questions and request different information, the General Partner may provide certain information to one or more prospective investors that it does not provide to all of the prospective or current investors of the Partnership.  In addition, certain Limited Partners may invest on terms that provide access to information that is not generally available to other Limited Partners and, as a result, may be able to act on such additional information that other Limited Partners do not receive.
<i>Diverse Limited Partner Group</i>. The Limited Partners may have conflicting investment, tax and other interests with respect to their investments in the Partnership. As a consequence, conflicts of interest may arise in connection with decisions made by the General Partner and/or its affiliate(s), including with respect to the nature or timing of the disposition of the Partnership’s investment, and such decisions may be more beneficial for one investor than for another, especially with respect to the investors’ individual tax situations. In making such decisions, the General Partner and/or its affiliate(s) will consider such investment and tax objectives of the Partnership and its Limited Partners as a whole, not the investment, tax or other objectives of any Limited Partner individually.
<i>Carried Interest</i>. The existence of the General Partner’s carried interest may create an incentive for the General Partner to operate the Partnership in a riskier or more speculative manner than would be the case absent such arrangement. Pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017 (the “<u>Tax Act</u>”), in order for the General Partner (or its direct or indirect equity holders) to benefit from certain favorable rates applicable to long-term capital gains with regard to its carried interest, the holding period for an underlying asset must be more than three years. In contrast, a Limited Partner who is a non-corporate U.S. person will be eligible for long-term capital gains rates if the holding period in any such asset is more than one year. The Tax Act may therefore create an incentive for the General Partner and/or its affiliate(s), in the interest of the General Partner, to hold the Partnership’s investment on behalf of the Partnership for longer than the General Partner would otherwise hold it in the absence of such new rule applicable to the General Partner.
<i>Other Fees</i>. The General Partner and/or its affiliate(s) may receive certain fees or other compensation from the company in which the Partnership has an interest in connection with the purchase or disposition of the Partnership’s investment or in connection with an unconsummated transaction (e.g., break-up, directors’, organizational, set-up, advisory and other similar fees). Conflicts may arise with respect to the payment of such fees.
