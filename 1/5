The fiscal year ("Fiscal year") of the Partnership shall be the calendar year or, in the case of the first and last fiscal years of the Partnership, the fraction thereof commencing on the Closing Date or ending on the date on which the winding up of the Partnership is completed, as the case may be. The taxable year of the Partnership shall be determined under Section 706 of the Code. The General Partner shall have the authority to change the ending date of the Fiscal Year if the General Partner determines in its sole discretion that such change is necessary or appropriate; provided that the General Partner shall promptly give notice of any such change to the Limited Partners.

1. <center>[clause="capital"]**CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS; DISTRIBUTIONS AND DEFAULT**</center>
    1. **<u>Capital Contributions**</u>.
       - <u>Capital Contributions</u>. Subject to <u>Section 3.1(c)</u>, each Partner agrees to make Capital Contributions to the capital of the Partnership in cash (up to the amount of total Capital Contributions set forth in such Partner's Subscription Documents) in such amounts and at such times as set forth in the Subscription Documents or called by the General Partner pursuant to this Agreement for the Partnership Expenses, payable in United States dollars.
       - <u>Related Definitions</u>.
         - A “<u>Payment Date</u>” shall mean the date(s) on which Partners are required to make Capital Contributions to the Partnership. If the Subscription Documents require Partners to make all of their Capital Contributions on or before the date of the closing in which they are admitted to the Partnership, then the Payment Date shall be the applicable closing. If the Subscription Documents require Partners to make their Capital Contributions pursuant to one or more Payment Notices, then the Payment Date shall be specified in the Payment Notice delivered by the General Partner to each Limited Partner, provided that the Payment Date with respect to the initial Payment Notice shall be at least three (3) Business Days after the date of the delivery of such Payment Notice and the Payment Date with respect to any subsequent Payment Notice shall be at least ten (10) Business Days after the date of delivery of such Payment Notice.
         - A "<u>Payment Notice</u>" shall mean a written notice requiring Capital Contributions to the Partnership, which notice shall:
              (A) specify the purpose for which the Capital Contributions are required to be made; and
              (B) specify each Limited Partner's Capital Contributions required to be made by such Limited Partner.
         - The "<u>Initial Payment Date</u>" shall mean the first date on which Limited Partners shall be required to make Capital Contributions.
       - With respect to each Limited Partner, Capital Contributions shall be made in U.S. dollars by wire transfer or check of immediately available funds to the account specified in the related Payment Notice.
       - Other than as set forth in this Article III, no Partner shall be entitled to any interest or compensation by reason of its Capital Contributions or by reason of serving as a Partner. No Partner shall be required to lend any funds to the Partnership.
       - The General Partner shall cause the books and records of the Partnership to be amended from time to time to reflect the names and addresses of Partners and changes thereto and the transfer of Interests and changes in Capital Contributions which are accomplished in accordance with the provisions hereof.
       - If the General Partner determines that a proposed Portfolio Investment in respect of which Partners have made Principal Capital Contributions will not be consummated, the General Partner shall refund to the Partners which made such Principal Capital Contributions the amounts of such Principal Capital Contributions (together with any earnings thereon). If the General Partner determines that a proposed Portfolio Investment in respect of which Partners have made Principal Capital Contributions will not require the full amount of Principal Capital Contributions made therefor, the General Partner shall refund to the Partners which made such Principal Capital Contributions, pro rata to the amounts of such Principal Capital Contributions, the amount of such Principal Capital Contributions which exceeds the portion required to consummate such Portfolio Investment (together with any earnings thereon). Any amount refunded pursuant to this <u>Section 3.1(f)</u> shall be treated for purposes of <u>Section 3.4(a)</u> as never having been contributed to the Partnership. Any amounts to be refunded pursuant to this <u>Section 3.1(f)</u> shall be refunded to the Limited Partners at such times and intervals as the General Partner shall determine, in its sole discretion, but in no event later than (i) ninety (90) days from the applicable Payment Date and (ii) ten (10) Business Days after the termination of any binding commitment to fund such Portfolio Investment.
    1. **<u>Subsequent Closings**</u>.
       - <u>Generally</u>. The General Partner may, in its sole discretion, admit additional Limited Partners, or permit any existing Limited Partner to increase its Principal Capital Contributions, at one or more subsequent closings for up to six (6) months after the Initial Payment Date ("Subsequent Closings").
       - Principal Capital Contributions for Portfolio Investments at Subsequent Closings. Each Limited Partner that is admitted or increases its Principal Capital Contribution at a Subsequent Closing shall make a Principal Capital Contribution to the Partnership in respect of a Follow-On Portfolio Investment to be made by the Partnership and not in respect of a pre-existing Portfolio Investment.
       - An existing Limited Partner whose Principal Capital Contribution is increased pursuant to clause (a) above shall be treated, for purposes of <u>Section 3.2</u>, as two Limited Partners, one being an additional Limited Partner that is admitted with a Principal Capital Contribution equal to such increase as of the Subsequent Closing date upon which such increase occurred and the other being an existing Limited Partner with a Principal Capital Contribution that is not increased.
    1. **<u>Distributions-General Principles**</u>.
       - Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Article III or in Articles VIII and IX, no Partner shall have the right to withdraw capital from the Partnership or to receive any distribution or return of its Capital Contribution. Distributions of Partnership assets that are provided for in this Article III or in Articles VIII and IX shall be made only to Persons who, according to the books and records of the Partnership, were the holders of record of Interests in the Partnership on the date determined by the General Partner as of which the Partners are entitled to any such distributions. It is generally expected that the Partnership will distribute cash or marketable securities in respect of all of the Portfolio Investments upon an initial public offering of the Portfolio Company or following an acquisition of the Portfolio Company. Any income generated by a Portfolio Investment shall be accrued until the Disposition of such Portfolio Investment.
       - Disposition Proceeds from a Portfolio Investment, and any accrued income associated therewith, shall be distributed as soon as practicable after receipt thereof but in any event within ninety (90) days after the date such Disposition Proceeds are received by the Partnership; provided that, in the case of any Portfolio Investment that is Disposed of in a series of related transactions, the General Partner shall not be required to distribute any Disposition Proceeds from such Portfolio Investment until the entire Portfolio Investment has been Disposed of.
       - For all purposes of this Agreement, whenever a portion of a Portfolio Investment (but not the entire Portfolio Investment) is the subject of a Disposition, that portion shall be treated as having been a separate Portfolio Investment from the portion of the Portfolio Investment that is retained by the Partnership, and any accrued income and Principal Capital Contributions for Portfolio Investment shall be treated as having been divided between the sold portion and the retained portion on a pro rata basis based on either the respective values of the portions of the Portfolio Investment immediately prior to such Disposition or such other method of allocation as the General Partner determines in good faith more accurately reflects the appropriate allocation of such amounts.
       - For all purposes of this Agreement, whenever a new investment is made, such subsequent investment shall be treated as a separate Portfolio Investment from the Portfolio Investments previously made, and Principal Capital Contributions for, and Disposition Proceeds and Carried Interest proceeds subsequently received in respect of all such investment shall, to the extent the General Partner determines in its sole discretion is practicable, be allocated on a specific identification basis or such other basis as the General Partner may determine appropriate in its good faith discretion.
       - The amount of any taxes paid by or withheld from receipts of the Partnership allocable to a Partner from a Portfolio Investment shall be deemed to have been distributed to such Partner as Disposition Proceeds to the extent that the payment or withholding of such taxes reduced Disposition Proceeds otherwise distributable to such Partner as provided herein. For this purpose, such taxes shall be allocated among the Partners proportionately based on their relative shares of the income or gain in question (and assuming that no such taxes have been paid or withheld); provided, however, that if any such taxes are imposed on or with respect to one or more, but not all of the Partners in the Partnership, the amount of the reduction shall be borne by the relevant Partners and treated as if it were paid by the Partnership as a Tax Advance with respect to such Partners pursuant to <u>Section 10.6(a)</u> for all purposes of this Agreement.
    1. **<u>Amounts and Priority of Distributions**</u>.
       - Distributions of Disposition Proceeds. Each distribution of Disposition Proceeds from a Portfolio Investment shall initially be apportioned to the Partners (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the General Partner (and/or its Affiliate(s), if applicable)) pro rata in proportion to each of their respective Percentage Interests with respect to such Portfolio Investment. The amount apportioned to the General Partner (and/or its Affiliate(s), if applicable) will be distributed to the General Partner (and/or such Affiliate(s), as applicable). The amount initially apportioned to a Limited Partner (other than any Affiliate of the General Partner) shall be further divided between such Limited Partner on the one hand and the General Partner on the other hand as follows:
         - First, 100% to such Limited Partner until such Limited Partner has received cumulative distributions of Disposition Proceeds (including for this purpose amounts deemed distributed to a Limited Partner pursuant to this Agreement) in an amount equal to such Limited Partner's Principal Capital Contributions, after taking into account distributions returned by such Limited Partner pursuant to <u>Section 5.2(b)</u>; and
         
         - {% if carta.premium_carry_percentage_primary == null %}Thereafter, {{(carta.lp_carried_interest * 100) | round(2)}}% to the Limited Partner and {{(carta.gp_carried_interest * 100) | round(2)}}% to the General Partner. {% else %}Second,

				    (A) if such Limited Partner has received cumulative distributions of Disposition Proceeds (including for this purpose amounts deemed distributed to a Limited Partner pursuant to this Agreement) pursuant to this <u>Section 3.4(a)(ii)</u> that are less than {{(carta.premium_carry_hurdle_rate_primary * 100) | round(2)}}% of its Principal Capital Contributions, then all distributions shall be made {{(carta.lp_carried_interest * 100) | round(2)}}% to the Limited Partner and {{(carta.gp_carried_interest * 100) | round(2)}}% to the General Partner;
            (B) if the Limited Partner has received cumulative distributions of Disposition Proceeds (including for this purpose amounts deemed distributed to a Limited Partner pursuant to this Agreement) pursuant to this <u>Section 3.4(a)(ii)</u> that are equal to or more than {{(carta.premium_carry_hurdle_rate_primary * 100) | round(2)}}% of its Principal Capital Contributions{% if carta.premium_carry_hurdle_rate_secondary != null %}, but less than {{(carta.premium_carry_hurdle_rate_secondary * 100) | round(2)}}% of its Principal Capital Contributions,{% endif %} then all distributions shall be made one hundred percent (100%) to the General Partner until the General Partner has received cumulative distributions with respect to the Limited Partner equal to {{(carta.premium_carry_percentage_primary * 100) | round(2)}}% of the excess of (I) the sum of the aggregate distributions made to the Limited Partner pursuant to <u>Sections 3.4(a)</u> and <u>9.3(b)</u> and to the General Partner with respect to the Limited Partner pursuant to this <u>Section 3.4(a)(ii)</u> over (II) the Principal Capital Contributions of the Limited Partner, and thereafter, all distributions shall be made {{(carta.premium_primary_carried_interest * 100) | round(2)}}% to the Limited Partner and {{(carta.premium_carry_percentage_primary * 100) | round(2)}}% to the General Partner; {% if carta.premium_carry_hurdle_rate_secondary != null %}or
            (C) if the Limited Partner has received cumulative distributions of Disposition Proceeds (including for this purpose amounts deemed distributed to a Limited Partner pursuant to this <u>Section 3.4(a)(ii)</u> that are equal to or more than {{(carta.premium_carry_hurdle_rate_secondary * 100) | round(2)}}% of its Principal Capital Contributions, then all distributions shall be made one hundred percent (100%) to the General Partner until the General Partner has received cumulative distributions with respect to the Limited Partner equal to {{(carta.premium_carry_percentage_secondary * 100) | round(2)}}% of the excess of (I) the sum of the aggregate distributions made to the Limited Partner pursuant to <u>Sections 4.2(a)</u> and <u>9.3(b)</u> and to the General Partner with respect to the Limited Partner pursuant to this <u>Section 3.4(a)(ii)</u>; over (II) the Principal Capital Contributions of the Limited Partner, and thereafter, all distributions shall be made {{(carta.premium_secondary_carried_interest * 100) | round(2)}}% to the Limited Partner and {{(carta.premium_carry_percentage_secondary * 100) | round(2)}}% to the General Partner.{% else %} {% endif %} {% endif %}
       - Waiver or Sharing of Carried Interest. For the avoidance of doubt, the General Partner, from time to time and in its sole discretion, may waive or reduce the Carried Interest to be distributed or otherwise paid to the General Partner by or on behalf of any Limited Partners. The General Partner may, in its sole discretion, share with one or more Persons all or any portion of any Carried Interest.
       - Disposition Proceeds Available for Distribution. Any unpaid Partnership Expenses or outstanding debts or obligations of the Partnership and any Partnership Expenses relating to the Disposition of a Portfolio Investment, including any brokerage commissions, escrow fees, clearing and settlement charges, and custodial fees shall be paid by the Partnership prior to any distribution pursuant to this <u>Section 3.4</u>. In addition, the amount of Disposition Proceeds that are distributable to the Limited Partners shall be net of the amount of cash which the General Partner, in its sole discretion, deems necessary or appropriate to establish reserves for the payment of future or potential Partnership Expenses, liabilities or obligations.
       - Temporary Investment Income. Temporary Investment Income shall be distributed to the Limited Partners pro rata in proportion to Principal Capital Contributions, or used to pay for Partnership Expenses, as determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion, and will not be distributed pursuant to <u>Section 3.4(a)</u>.

    1. **<u>Defaulting Limited Partner**</u>.
       - Except as otherwise expressly provided under this Agreement, in the event that a Limited Partner fails to make any Capital Contribution payment required to be paid hereunder, and such failure continues for twenty (20) days after receipt of notice of such default, then such Limited Partner shall be in default (a “Defaulting Limited Partner”) and may, in addition to such other rights and remedies as may be available to it under applicable law, be subject to the provisions of this <u>Section 3.5</u>.
       - Except as provided in this <u>Section 3.5(b)</u>, a Defaulting Limited Partner shall not be entitled to make any further Principal Capital Contributions to the Partnership. The General Partner shall impose a default charge on the Defaulting Limited Partner (as calculated pursuant to <u>Section 3.5(d)</u>) and will have the option to take one (1) or more of the following steps:
         - offer each non-Defaulting Limited Partner the opportunity to elect to increase its Interest by its pro rata share of the Principal Capital Contribution owed to the Partnership by the Defaulting Limited Partner, such pro rata share determined on the basis of such non-Defaulting Limited Partner’s Principal Capital Contribution(s) at the time of default compared to the total Principal Capital Contributions of all non-Defaulting Limited Partners that elect to increase their Interests at such time (if a nonDefaulting Limited Partner increases its Interest under this <u>Section 3.5(b)(i)</u>, then such non-Defaulting Limited Partner’s Percentage Interest shall be adjusted to reflect the increased Interest of such Limited Partner);
         - reduce the Defaulting Limited Partner’s Interest (including, without limitation, the Defaulting Limited Partner’s Percentage Interest and Capital Account) by fifty percent (50%) and reallocate such reduced Percentage Interest and Capital Account among all Limited Partners other than the Defaulting Limited Partner on terms established by the General Partner in its discretion, provided that the amount so reallocated to any Limited Partner shall not reduce the Interest of such non-Defaulting Limited Partner;
         - cause a forfeiture of any portion of an Interest back to the Partnership which such Defaulting Limited Partner was issued but had not yet paid for at the time of the default and reduce such Defaulting Limited Partner’s Interest to the amount such Defaulting Limited Partner has contributed as of the date thereof. In addition, the Partnership will have the authority to sell the Interest attributable to the unfulfilled Interest to the other investors;
         - assist the Defaulting Limited Partner in selling its Interest in the Partnership;
         - accept a late Capital Contribution from the Defaulting Limited Partner (with interest calculated pursuant to <u>Section 3.5(d)</u>);
         - require that, whenever the vote, consent, or decision of a Limited Partner or of the Limited Partners is required or permitted pursuant to this Agreement, any Defaulting Limited Partner shall, to the extent determined by the General Partner, not be entitled to participate in such vote or consent, or to make such decision, and, to such extent determined by the General Partner, such vote, consent or decision shall be tabulated or made as if such Defaulting Limited Partner were not a Limited Partner; and
         - pursue and enforce all of the Partnership’s other rights and remedies against the Defaulting Limited Partner that may exist under this Agreement or applicable law.
       - For avoidance of doubt, no right, power or remedy conferred in this <u>Section 3.5</u> shall be exclusive, and each such right, power or remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to every other right, power or remedy whether conferred in this <u>Section 3.5</u> or now or hereafter available at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise. No course of dealing among the Partners and no delay in exercising any right, power or remedy conferred in this <u>Section 3.5</u>, or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise shall operate as a waiver or otherwise prejudice any such right, power or remedy.
       - The default charge imposed on a Defaulting Limited Partner pursuant to this <u>Section 3.5</u> shall equal the lesser of (i) the Default Rate or, (ii) the highest rate permitted by applicable law, on any past due amount from the date such amount became due until the date on which such payment is received by the Partnership (by application of withheld distributions or otherwise), or such lower amount, as determined by the General Partner in its discretion. Any such default charge so paid by a Defaulting Limited Partner shall be distributed to the non-Defaulting Limited Partners. Amounts contributed by a Defaulting Limited Partner in respect of the default charge as required by this <u>Section 3.5</u> shall not be considered a Principal Capital Contribution for purposes of this Agreement.

1. <center>[clause="manager"]**THE GENERAL PARTNER**</center>

    1. **<u>Investments**</u>. The Partnership will invest in Portfolio Investments and, at such time as any funds of the Partnership are not invested in Portfolio Investments or distributed to the Partners, the General Partner shall maintain such funds either in Temporary Investments or, to the extent the General Partner determines in good faith it is not reasonably practical to do so, in cash
    1. **<u>Powers of the General Partner**</u>.
       - The management, operation and policy of the Partnership shall be vested exclusively in the General Partner, which shall have the power by itself and shall be authorized and empowered on behalf and in the name of the Partnership to carry out any and all of the objects and purposes of the Partnership and to perform all acts and enter into and perform all contracts and other undertakings that it may in its sole discretion deem necessary or advisable or incidental thereto, all in accordance with and subject to the other terms of this Agreement.

       - The General Partner has currently delegated to the Administrator the authority to, among other things, handle the fund administration services relating to the Partnership and the Partners.

       - The General Partner may delegate to its Affiliate, if any, the authority to, among other things, perform all of the Partnership’s investment-related activities and make all of the Partnership’s investment-related decisions.
    1. **<u>Limitation on Liability; Standard of Care**</u>.
       - None of the General Partner, its Affiliate(s), if any, nor each of their respective direct or indirect officers, directors, stockholders, members, employees, partners (other than Limited Partners in their capacity as such), representatives, agents, including without limitation, the Administrator, and any other Person who serves at the request of the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership as an officer, director, member, stockholder, partner, employee of the Partnership or any other entity (each of the foregoing, an “Protected Person”) shall be liable to the Partnership or to any Limited Partner for (i) any act or omission taken or suffered or any act or omission allegedly taken or suffered, even if negligent by any Protected Person in connection with the conduct of the affairs of the Partnership, the Portfolio Company in connection with this Agreement or the matters contemplated herein, unless it is determined in each case by any court or governmental body of competent jurisdiction in a final judgment or admitted by such Protected Person in a settlement of any lawsuit (other than in the context of a temporary, preliminary or similar injunction) that such act or omission resulted from fraud, bad faith, willful misconduct, gross negligence, a material breach of this Agreement by such Protected Person, which breach shall not have been cured within thirty (30) days after such breach, and except that nothing herein shall constitute a waiver or limitation of any rights which a Partner or the Partnership may have under applicable securities laws or other laws and which may not be waived or (ii) any mistake, negligence, dishonesty or bad faith of any broker, adviser or other agent of the Partnership selected by the General Partner with reasonable care.
       - The General Partner shall exercise its powers and duties hereunder by acting in good faith, in what was reasonably believed to be in the best interest of the Partnership and that was reasonably believed to be within the scope of the authority conferred upon the General Partner by this Agreement. To the extent that, at law or in equity or otherwise, a Protected Person has duties (including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to the Partnership or to another Partner, such Protected Person acting under this Agreement shall not be liable to the Partnership or to any such other Partner for its good faith reliance on the provisions of this Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement, to the extent that they expand, eliminate or restrict the duties and liabilities of the Protected Persons otherwise existing at law or in equity or otherwise, are agreed by the Partners to modify to that extent such other duties and liabilities of such Protected Persons. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Administrator owes no fiduciary duties of any kind whatsoever to the Partnership, or to any of the Partners, including, but not limited to, the duties of due care and loyalty, whether those duties were established as of the date of this Agreement or any time hereafter, and whether established under common law, at equity or legislatively defined.
       - The General Partner may consult with legal counsel and accountants selected by it and any act or omission suffered or taken by it on behalf of the Partnership or in furtherance of the interests of the Partnership in good faith in reasonable reliance upon and in accordance with the advice of such counsel or accountants shall be full justification for any such act or omission, and such Protected Persons shall be fully protected in so acting or omitting to act; provided that such counsel or accountants were selected with reasonable care.
    1. **<u>Indemnification**</u>.
       - To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Partnership shall indemnify and hold harmless each of the Protected Persons from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs and expenses (including amounts paid in satisfaction of judgments, in compromises and settlements, as fines and penalties and legal or other costs and reasonable expenses of investigating or defending against any claim or alleged claim) of any nature whatsoever, known or unknown, liquidated or unliquidated, whether or not in connection with proceedings by or in the right of the Partnership, that are incurred by any Protected Person and/or to which such Protected Person may be subject by reason of its activities or omissions or alleged activities or omissions, even if negligent, on behalf of the Partnership or in furtherance of the interest of the Partnership or otherwise arising out of or in connection with the affairs of the Partnership or the Portfolio Company or the performance by such Protected Person of any of the General Partner's responsibilities hereunder; provided that: (i) a Protected Person shall be entitled to indemnification hereunder only to the extent that such Protected Person's conduct did not constitute (as determined in each case by any court or governmental body of competent jurisdiction in a final judgment or admitted by such Protected Person in a settlement of any lawsuit (other than in the context of a temporary, preliminary or similar injunction)) fraud, bad faith, willful misconduct, gross negligence, a material breach of this Agreement, which breach shall not have been cured within thirty (30) days after such breach; (ii) nothing herein shall constitute a waiver or limitation of any rights which a Partner or the Partnership may have under applicable securities laws or other laws and which may not be waived; and (iii) the Partnership's obligations hereunder shall not apply with respect to (w) economic losses or tax obligations incurred by any Protected Person as a result of such Protected Person's ownership of an interest in the Partnership or in the Portfolio Company, (x) expenses of the Partnership that a Protected Person has agreed to bear, (y) claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs and expenses arising solely out of disputes between or among the members, partners or shareholders of the General Partner or (z) claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs and expenses arising solely out of any Protected Person's service to the Portfolio Company occurring after the Partnership has Disposed of such Portfolio Investment. The satisfaction of any indemnification and any saving harmless pursuant to this <u>Section 4.4(a)</u> shall be from and limited to Partnership assets and no Partner shall have any personal liability on account thereof; provided that each Limited Partner will be obligated to return any amounts distributed to it in order to fund any deficiency in the Partnership's indemnity obligations hereunder to the extent provided in <u>Section 5.2</u>.
       - Expenses reasonably incurred by a Protected Person in defense or settlement of any claim that may be subject to a right of indemnification hereunder shall be advanced by the Partnership prior to the final disposition thereof upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Protected Person to repay such amount to the extent that it shall be determined ultimately that such Protected Person is not entitled to be indemnified. No advances shall be made by the Partnership under this <u>Section 4.4(b)</u> without the prior written approval of the General Partner.
       - The right of any Protected Person to the indemnification provided herein shall be cumulative of, and in addition to, any and all rights to which such Protected Person may otherwise be entitled by contract or as a matter of law or equity and shall extend to such Protected Person's successors, assigns and legal representatives.
       - Any Protected Person shall first seek recovery under any other indemnity or any insurance policies by which such Protected Person is indemnified or covered, as the case may be, but only to the extent that the indemnitor with respect to such indemnity or the insurer with respect to such insurance policy provides (or acknowledges its obligation to provide) such indemnity or coverage, as the case may be, on a timely basis. To the extent that a Protected Person receives an indemnification payment from the Partnership under <u>Section 4.4</u> in respect of the conduct of such Protected Person and then recovers amounts in respect of such conduct under any insurance policies referred to in the preceding sentence, such Protected Person shall return such recovered amounts (net of expenses incurred in connection with such recovery) to the Partnership up to the amount of such indemnification previously paid by the Partnership. For any such Protected Person other than the General Partner, such Protected Person shall obtain the written consent of the General Partner prior to entering into any compromise or settlement which would result in an obligation of the Partnership to indemnify such Protected Person. If liabilities arise out of the conduct of the affairs of the Partnership and any other Person for which the Protected Person was then acting in a similar capacity, the amount of the indemnification provided by the Partnership shall be limited to the Partnership's proportionate share thereof as determined in good faith by the General Partner.
       - Any Protected Person shall be deemed to be a creditor of the Partnership and shall be entitled to enforce the obligations of Partners to return distributions pursuant to <u>Section 5.2</u> following the termination of the Partnership.
       - The General Partner may in its sole discretion cause the Partnership to purchase, at the Partnership's expense, insurance to insure the General Partner or any other Protected Person against liability for any breach or alleged breach of their responsibilities under this Agreement or otherwise in connection with the Partnership or the General Partner.
       - To the extent any indemnitor described in the first sentence of <u>Section 4.4(d)</u> is the Portfolio Company, it is intended that the Portfolio Company shall be liable on a primary basis to the applicable Person entitled to indemnification from the Partnership hereunder.

    1. **<u>Valuation**</u>. The Fair Value of the Portfolio Investment shall be calculated by reference to the fair value determined by the General Partner in accordance with written guidelines, which guidelines are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; provided that, solely for purposes of allocating Disposition Proceeds among the Limited Partners and the General Partner, the valuation methodology for marketable securities (before or during the winding-up period of the Partnership) shall be based on the average of their closing sale price on the principal securities exchange on which they are traded on each Business Day during the ten (10) days prior to the date of such distribution, or if the principal market for such marketable securities is, or is deemed to be, in the over-the-counter market, their average opening "bid" and "asked" prices on each Business Day during such period, or if such price is not so published, the average mean between their opening "bid" and "asked" prices, if available, on each Business Day during such period, which prices may be obtained from any reputable broker or dealer. For all purposes of this Agreement, all determinations of Fair Value which have been made inaccordance with the terms of Section 4.8 shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive on the Partnership and all Partners, their successors and assigns. The Limited Partner agrees that the Fair Value of any non-marketable securities when such Fair Value must be determined shall be determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion.
    1. **<u>Key Individual**</u>.

The General Partner and its Affiliate(s), if any, each has other business interests, engages in other business activities and sponsors or manages other pooled investment vehicles. The General Partner and its Affiliate(s), if any, may acquire interests in the Partnership or other pooled investment vehicles sponsored or managed by the General Partner or its Affiliate(s), if any.

The Administrator is not obligated to devote all or any specific portion of its time or business efforts to the affairs of the Partnership, and shall only devote the time, effort and skill as the Administrator determines in its sole discretion is necessary or appropriate to comply with its obligations under this Agreement. The Administrator may engage in or possess any interest in other business ventures of any kind, nature or description, independently or with others, whether those ventures are competitive with the Partnership or otherwise.

The Administrator may acquire or possess interests in the Portfolio Company and the interests may be of a different class or type, with different rights and preferences, than those held by the Partnership. The Administrator may acquire or possess interests in other companies or business ventures that are competitive with the Portfolio Company or the Partnership. Neither the Partnership nor any Limited Partner will have the right, by virtue of this Agreement or otherwise, to share or participate in the other investments or activities of the Administrator or to the profits or income derived therefrom.

    1. **<u>Management**</u>.
       - Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, no Limited Partner shall have the right or power to participate in the management or affairs of the Partnership, nor shall any Limited Partner have the power to sign for or bind the Partnership or deal with third parties on behalf of the Partnership. The exercise by any Limited Partner of any right conferred herein shall not be construed to constitute participation by such Limited Partner in the control of the business of the Partnership so as to make such Limited Partner liable as a general partner for the debts and obligations of the Partnership for purposes of the Act.
       - Any Limited Partner may, upon notice to the General Partner, elect to hold all or any fraction of such Limited Partner's Interest as a non-voting Interest, in which case such Limited Partner shall not be entitled to participate in any consent of the Limited Partners with respect to the portion of its Interest which is held as a nonvoting Interest (and such non-voting Interest shall not be counted in determining the giving or withholding of any such consent). Except as provided in <u>Section 5.1</u>, an Interest held as a non-voting Interest shall be identical in all regards to all other Interests held by Limited Partners. Any such election shall be irrevocable and shall bind the assignees of such Limited Partner's Interest.
    1. **<u>Liabilities of the Limited Partners**</u>
       - Generally, except as provided by the Act or other applicable law and subject to the obligations to make Capital Contributions pursuant to Article III, to indemnify the Partnership and the Partners as provided in <u>Section 10.6(a)</u>, to return distributions as provided in <u>Section 5.2(b)</u>, to pay any expenses relating to the Transfer of such Limited Partner's Interest as provided in <u>Section 8.2(a)</u> and to repay the Partnership in respect of any Tax Advances made to such Partner as provided in <u>Section 10.6(a)</u>, no Limited Partner shall have any personal liability whatsoever in its capacity as a Limited Partner, whether to the Partnership, to any of the Partners, or to the creditors of the Partnership, for the debts, liabilities, contracts, or other obligations of the Partnership or for any losses of the Partnership; provided that a Limited Partner shall be required to return any distribution that was made to such Limited Partner in error.
       - Limited Partner Clawback. Except as required by the Act, or other applicable law, or as otherwise required by the terms of this Agreement, no Limited Partner shall be required to repay to the Partnership, any Partner or any creditor of the Partnership all or any part of the distributions made to such Limited Partner pursuant to Article III hereof; provided that to the maximum extent permitted by law and subject to the limitations set forth in <u>Section 5.2 (c)(ii)</u> below, the General Partner may require a Limited Partner (including any former Limited Partner) to return distributions made to such Limited Partner or former Limited Partner (or any of its predecessors in interest) for the purpose of meeting such Limited Partner's share (as provided in <u>Section 5.2(c)</u> below) of the Partnership's indemnity obligations under <u>Section 4.4</u> in an amount up to, but in no event in excess of, the aggregate amount of distributions actually received by such Limited Partner from the Partnership. However, if, notwithstanding the terms of this Agreement, it is determined under applicable law that any Limited Partner has received a distribution which is required to be returned to or for the account of the Partnership or Partnership creditors, then the obligation under applicable law of any Limited Partner to return all or any part of a distribution made to such Limited Partner shall be the obligation of such Limited Partner and not of any other Partner. Any amount returned by a Limited Partner pursuant to this <u>Section 5.2(b)</u> shall be treated as a contribution of capital to the Partnership.
       - Determination of Each Partner's Share of Clawback.
         - Subject to the restrictions contained in clause (ii) below, if an indemnification obligation occurs for which a clawback, pursuant to <u>Section 5.2(b)</u>, is necessary (the "Clawback Amount"), each Partner (or former Partner) shall be obligated to contribute an amount equal to the product of the percentage that such Partner's Principal Capital Contribution represents of the total Principal Capital Contributions of the Partners and such Clawback Amount. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if distributions of Carried Interest in respect of any Limited Partner have been made to the General Partner, such Limited Partner's share of such Clawback Amount shall be reduced, and the General Partner's share of such Clawback Amount shall be increased, by an amount equal to such Carried Interest distributions.
         - The obligation of a Limited Partner to return distributions made to such Limited Partner for the purpose of meeting the Partnership's indemnity obligations under <u>Section 4.4</u> shall be subject to the following limitations: (A) no Limited Partner shall be required to return a distribution (including the Final Distribution) after the second anniversary of the date of such distribution; provided that if at the end of such period, there are any Proceedings then pending or any other liability (whether contingent or otherwise) or claim then outstanding, the General Partner shall so notify the Limited Partners at such time (which notice shall include a brief description of each such Proceeding (and of the liabilities asserted in such Proceeding) or of such liabilities and claims) and the obligation of the Limited Partners to return any distribution for the purpose of meeting the Partnership's indemnity obligations under <u>Section 4.4</u> shall survive with respect to each such Proceeding, liability and claim set forth in such notice (or any related Proceeding, liability or claim based upon the same or a similar claim) until the date that such Proceeding, liability or claim is ultimately resolved and satisfied.
    1. **<u>Limited Partners' Outside Activities**</u>. A Limited Partner shall be entitled to and may have business interests and engage in activities in addition to those relating to the Partnership, including business interests and activities in direct competition with the Partnership and the Portfolio Company.

The Expense Reserve Capital Contribution shall be set aside by the General Partner as reserves to pay for (and/or reimburse the General Partner for) the Partnership Expenses (the “Expense Reserve”). To the extent that the Expense Reserve is not sufficient to cover all of the Partnership Expenses, any excess Partnership Expenses shall be paid by the General Partner and/or out of the proceeds available for distribution pursuant to <u>Section 3.4(c)</u>. If the cash set aside for the Expense Reserve is not fully utilized at the time of an Event of Dissolution, any remaining cash set aside for the Expense Reserve will be distributed pursuant to <u>Section 9.3(b)</u>.
       - Notwithstanding the Limited Partner’s Expense Reserve Capital Contributions, the General Partner may withhold from any distributions amounts necessary to create, in its sole discretion, appropriate reserves for indemnities and any required tax withholdings or other payments attributable to any Partner (including pursuant to the Partnership Audit Provisions). Certain taxes paid or withheld by the Partnership will be deemed distributed for purposes hereof. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Partnership, and the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership, shall not be required to make a distribution to a Partner on account of its Interest in the Partnership if such distribution would violate the Act or any other applicable law, and if any Limited Partner receives a distribution made in error or in violation of applicable law, such Limited Partner shall be obligated promptly upon demand of the General Partner to return such distribution to the Partnership.

No Transferee of an Interest of any Limited Partner may be admitted as a substitute Limited Partner in the Partnership without the consent of the General Partner, which consent may be given or withheld in its sole discretion; provided that if such Transferee is a Person described in clauses (i)-(iii) above, such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. A Transferee shall be deemed admitted as a Limited Partner upon the execution of a counterpart signature page to this Agreement (or other document pursuant to which it agrees to be bound by the terms hereof) and, to the extent the transferring Limited Partner Transferred its entire Interest, immediately following the admission of the Transferee as a Limited Partner, the transferring Limited Partner shall cease to be a limited partner of the Partnership. A Transferee of an Interest that is not admitted as a substitute Limited Partner shall be entitled only to allocations and distributions with respect to that Interest and shall have no rights to vote such Interest, to participate in the management of the Partnership or to any information or accounting of the affairs of the Partnership and shall not have any of the other rights of a Partner pursuant to this Agreement.
       - Any attempted Transfer or substitution not made in accordance with this <u>Section 8.2</u> shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be null and void. The General Partner may waive any requirements of this <u>Section 8.2</u> in its discretion.

       - A Limited Partner may be required to withdraw from the Partnership if in the reasonable judgment of the General Partner (i) the Partnership or any Partner is reasonably likely to be subject to any requirement to register under the 1940 Act or (ii) a significant delay, extraordinary expense or material adverse effect on the Partners, the Partnership, the General Partner and/or any of its Affiliate(s), if any, any Portfolio Investment or Portfolio Company or any proposed or future Portfolio Investment is likely to result from such Limited Partner's continued Interest in the Partnership; provided that any such Limited Partner shall remain liable to the Partnership to the extent of any breach of a representation or covenant made by such Limited Partner to the Partnership or the General Partner arising out of or relating to such withdrawal.
       - A Limited Partner shall have the power to withdraw from the Partnership if, by reason of a change in any law, regulation or governmental order to which such Limited Partner is subject occurring after its admission to the Partnership, a violation of any such law, regulation or order would result without such withdrawal, provided that any such Limited Partner shall remain liable to the Partnership to the extent of any breach of a representation, warranty or covenant made by such Limited Partner to the Partnership arising out of or relating to such withdrawal. A Limited Partner seeking to withdraw pursuant to this <u>Section 8.5(b)</u> shall supply such opinions of counsel reasonably acceptable to the General Partner and such other information as the General Partner may reasonably request, satisfactory in form and substance to the General Partner, to verify the basis of such Limited Partner's right to withdraw pursuant to this <u>Section 8.5(b)</u> .
       - A complete or partial withdrawal pursuant to this <u>Section 8.5</u> will be effected by the Partnership's purchase of such Limited Partner's Interest (or portion thereof) in the Partnership at a price equal to the Appraised Value With Carry.

       - The determination by the General Partner in good faith that such earlier dissolution and termination is necessary or advisable because there has been a material adverse change in any applicable law or regulation affecting the Partnership, its Portfolio Investment(s) and/or the Portfolio Company, or to avoid any violation of, or registration under, applicable law or regulation;
       - The determination by the General Partner at any time to dissolve the Partnership;
       - The effective date of dissolution pursuant to <u>Section 8.1(b)(i)</u>;
       - At any time that there are no Limited Partners of the Partnership, unless the business of the Partnership is continued in accordance with the Act; or
       - The entry of a decree of judicial dissolution under Section 17-802 of the Act.
    1. **<u>Winding-up**</u>. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Dissolution, the Partnership shall be wound up, liquidated and subsequently terminated. The General Partner or, if there is no general partner, or if the General Partner has defaulted on its obligations to make Capital Contributions, a liquidator appointed by a Majority in Interest of the Partners, shall proceed with the Dissolution Sale and the Final Distribution. In the Dissolution Sale, the General Partner or such liquidator shall use its reasonable efforts to reduce to cash and cash equivalent items such assets of the Partnership as the General Partner or such liquidator shall deem it advisable to sell in an orderly fashion, subject to obtaining Fair Value for such assets and any tax or other legal or contractual considerations.
    1. **<u>Final Distribution**</u>. After the Dissolution Sale, the proceeds thereof and the other assets of the Partnership, which, for the avoidance of doubt, may include marketable securities or restricted securities, shall be distributed in one or more installments in the following order of priority:
       - to pay all creditors of the Partnership (including the payment of the expenses of the winding-up, liquidation and dissolution of the Partnership), including Partners who are creditors of the Partnership, to the extent otherwise permitted by law, either by the payment thereof or the making of reasonable provision therefor (including the establishment of reserves, in amounts established by the General Partner or such liquidator);
       - The remaining proceeds, if any, plus any remaining assets of the Partnership and any remaining cash set aside for Partnership Expenses, shall be applied and distributed to the Partners by the end of such taxable year or, if later, within ninety (90) days after the date of such liquidation in the same manner as distributions under <u>Section 3.4</u>. For purposes of the application of this <u>Section 9.3</u> and determining Capital Accounts on liquidation, all unrealized gains, losses and accrued income and deductions of the Partnership shall be treated as realized and recognized immediately before the date of distribution. If a Limited Partner shall, upon the advice of counsel, determine that there is a reasonable likelihood that any distribution in kind of an asset would cause such Limited Partner to be in violation of any law, regulation or order, such Limited Partner and the General Partner shall each use its commercially reasonable efforts to make alternative arrangements for the sale or transfer into an escrow account of any such distribution on mutually agreeable terms. 
		The Limited Partners understand and agree that there will be {% if carta.has_audit == true %}a {% else %} no{% endif %} liquidation audit prepared in connection with the dissolution of the Partnership.

1. <center>[clause="accounts"]**CAPITAL ACCOUNTS AND ALLOCATIONS OF PROFITS AND LOSSES**</center>
    1. **<u>Capital Accounts**</u>.
       - A separate capital account (the "Capital Account") shall be established and maintained for each Partner.

To the extent not provided for in the preceding sentence, the Capital Accounts of the Partners shall be adjusted and maintained in accordance with the rules of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-1(b) and 1.704-2, as the same may be amended or revised; provided that such adjustment and maintenance does not have a material adverse effect on the economic interests of the Partners. Any references in any Section of this Agreement to the Capital Account of a Partner shall be deemed to refer to such Capital Account as the same may be credited or debited from time to time as set forth above. In the event of any transfer of any interest in the Partnership in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the transferee shall succeed to the Capital Account of the transferor to the extent it relates to the transferred interest.
       - No Partner shall be required to pay to the Partnership or to any other Partner the amount of any negative balance which may exist from time to time in such Partner's Capital Account.
    1. **<u>Allocations of Profits and Losses**</u>. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Profits and Losses and, to the extent necessary, individual items of income, gain, loss or deduction of the Partnership shall be allocated among the Partners in a manner such that the Capital Account of each Partner, immediately after making such allocation, is, as nearly as possible, equal (proportionately) to (i) the hypothetical distributions that would be made to such Partner pursuant to <u>Section 3.4</u> if the Partnership's assets were sold for cash equal to their Carrying Value, all Partnership liabilities were satisfied (limited with respect to each nonrecourse liability to the Carrying Value of the assets securing such liability), and the net assets of the Partnership were distributed in accordance with <u>Section 3.4</u> to the Partners immediately after making such allocation, minus (ii) such Partner's share of Partnership Minimum Gain and Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain, computed immediately prior to the hypothetical sale of assets, minus (iii) in the case of each Limited Partner, any obligation of such Limited Partner to make any capital contribution to the Partnership pursuant to <u>Section 5.2(b)</u>. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner may make such allocations as it deems reasonably necessary to give economic effect to the provisions of this Agreement, taking into account facts and circumstances as the General Partner deems reasonably necessary for this purpose.<br><br>For the avoidance of doubt, it is the intention of the Partners that, to the extent permitted by law, allocations made to the General Partner and/or its Affiliates in respect of their Capital Contributions, if any, are intended to (i) be treated as “capital interest allocations” exempt from the provisions of Section 1061 of the Code (as described in Treasury Regulations Section 1.1061-3(c)(3) or any similar provision); (ii) be “separate and apart,” within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1061-3(c)(3)(ii)(B), from any allocations made to the General Partner in respect of its Carried Interest attributable to the other Partners; and (iii) meet the identification requirements of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1061-3(c)(3)(ii)(B).
    1. **<u>Special Allocation Provisions**</u>. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Article X:
       - Minimum Gain Chargeback. Except as otherwise provided in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(f), notwithstanding any other provision of this Article X, if there is a net decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain during any taxable year (or other relevant period), each Partner shall be specially allocated items of Partnership income and gain for such taxable year (or other relevant period) (and, if necessary, subsequent taxable year (or other relevant period)) in an amount equal to such Partner’s share of the net decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain, determined in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(g). Allocations pursuant to the previous sentence shall be made in proportion to the respective amounts required to be allocated to each Partner in accordance with Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-2(f)(6) and 1.704-2(j)(2). This <u>Section 10.3(a)</u> is intended to comply with the minimum gain chargeback requirements in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(f) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.

       - Partner Minimum Gain Chargeback. Except as otherwise provided in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(4), notwithstanding any other provision of this Article X, if there is a net decrease in Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain attributable to a Partner Nonrecourse Debt during any taxable year (or other relevant period), each Partner who has a share of the Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain attributable to such Partner Nonrecourse Debt, determined in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(5), shall be specially allocated items of Partnership income and gain for such taxable year (or other relevant period) (and, if necessary, subsequent taxable year (or other relevant period)) in an amount equal to such Partner’s share of the net decrease in Partner Nonrecourse Debt, determined in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(4). Allocations pursuant to the previous sentence shall be made in proportion to the respective amounts required to be allocated to each Partner pursuant thereto. The items to be allocated shall be determined in accordance with Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-2(i)(4) and 1.704-2(j)(2). This Section 10.3(b) is intended to comply with the minimum gain chargeback requirement in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(4) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.
       - Qualified Income Offset. If any Partner unexpectedly receives any adjustments, allocations or distributions described in Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5) or (6) resulting in, or increasing, an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit for such Partner, items of Partnership income and gain shall be specially allocated to each such Partner in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate, to the extent required by the Treasury Regulations, the Adjusted Capital Account Deficit of such Partner as quickly as possible; provided, that an allocation pursuant to this Section 10.3(c) shall be made only if and to the extent that such Partner would have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit after all other allocations provided for in this Article X have been tentatively made as if this <u>Section 10.3(c)</u> were not in this Agreement.
       - Gross Income Allocation. In addition, if any Partner has an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit at the end of any taxable year (or other relevant period), each such Partner shall be specially allocated items of Partnership income and gain in the amount of such excess as quickly as possible; provided, that an allocation pursuant to this </u>Section 10.3(c)</u> shall be made only if and to the extent that such Partner would have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit after all other allocations provided for in this Article X have been tentatively made as if </u>Section 10.3(c)</u> were not in this Agreement.
       - Stop Loss. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of <u>Section 10.2</u>, the Losses (or items of expense or deduction or loss) allocated pursuant to <u>Section 10.2</u> shall not exceed the maximum amount that can be so allocated without causing any Partner to have a deficit Adjusted Capital Account at the end of any taxable year (or other relevant period). In the event some but not all of the Partner would have a deficit Adjusted Capital Account as a consequence of an allocation of Losses pursuant to <u>Section 10.2</u>, the limitation set forth in this <u>Section 10.3(e)</u> shall be applied on a Partner by Partner basis so as to allocate the maximum permissible Losses to each Partner under Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d). All Losses (or items of expense or deduction or loss) in excess of the limitation set forth in this <u>Section 10.3(e)</u> shall be allocated to other Partners in accordance with the positive balances in such Partners' Adjusted Capital Accounts so as to allocate the maximum permissible Losses to each Partner under Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d).
       - Nonrecourse Deductions. Nonrecourse Deductions for any taxable year (or other relevant period) shall be specially allocated in a manner permitted under Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(e) and selected by the General Partner.
       - Partner Nonrecourse Deductions. Any Partner Nonrecourse Deductions for any taxable period shall be allocated to the Partner who bears the economic risk of loss with respect to the liability to which such Partner Nonrecourse Deductions are attributable in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(j).
       - Section 754 Adjustments. Items of income, gain, loss, and deductions shall be specifically allocated to the Partners to comply with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m).
       - Payee Allocation. In the event any payment to any Person that is treated by the Partnership as the payment of an expense is recharacterized by a taxing authority as a Partnership distribution to the payee as a partner, such payee shall be specially allocated an amount of Partnership gross income and gain as quickly as possible equal to the amount of the distribution.
       - Regulatory Allocations. The allocations set forth in <u>Sections 10.3(a)</u> through (i) (collectively, the "Regulatory Allocations") are intended to comply with certain requirements of the Treasury Regulations. It is the intent of the parties to this Agreement that, to the extent possible, all Regulatory Allocations will be offset in the current taxable year or future taxable years either with other Regulatory Allocations or with special allocations of other items of Partnership income, gain, loss or deduction pursuant to this </u>Section 10.3(j)</u>.
    1. **<u>Tax Allocations**</u>. For income tax purposes only, each item of income, gain, loss and deduction of the Partnership shall be allocated among the Partners in the same manner as the corresponding items of Profits and Losses and specially allocated items are allocated for Capital Account purposes; provided that in the case of any Partnership asset the Carrying Value of which differs from its adjusted tax basis for U.S. federal income tax purposes, income, gain, loss and deduction with respect to such asset shall be allocated solely for income tax purposes in accordance with the principles of Sections 704(b) and (c) of the Code (in any manner determined by the General Partner) so as to take account of the difference between Carrying Value and adjusted basis of such asset. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner in its sole discretion shall make allocations for tax purposes as may be needed to ensure that allocations are in accordance with the interests of the Partners within the meaning of the Code and the Regulations. The General Partner shall determine all matters concerning allocations for tax purposes not expressly provided for herein in its sole discretion.
    1. **<u>Other Allocation Provisions**</u>. The foregoing provisions and the other provisions of this Agreement relating to the maintenance of Capital Accounts are intended to comply with Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-l(b) and shall be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with such regulations. <u>Section 10.2</u> to <u>Section 10.5</u> may be amended at any time by the General Partner if necessary, in the opinion of tax counsel to the Partnership, to comply with such regulations, so long as any such amendment does not materially change the relative economic interests of the Partners.
    1. **<u>Tax Advances**</u>.
       - To the extent the General Partner reasonably determines that the Partnership is required by law to withhold or to make tax or any other payments on behalf of or with respect to any Partner (or direct or indirect shareholder, member, or other owner of such Partner), including withholding taxes, and state unincorporated business taxes, and payments pursuant to the Revised Partnership Audit Provisions ("Tax Advances"), the General Partner may withhold such amounts and make such tax payments as so required. All Tax Advances made on behalf of a Partner shall, in the sole discretion of the General Partner, (i) be promptly paid to the Partnership by the Partner on whose behalf such Tax Advances were made or (ii) be repaid by reducing the amount of the current or next succeeding distribution or distributions which would otherwise have been made to such Partner or, if such distributions are not sufficient for that purpose, by so reducing the proceeds of liquidation otherwise payable to such Partner. Whenever the General Partner selects option (ii) pursuant to the preceding sentence for repayment of a Tax Advance by a Partner, for all other purposes of this Agreement such Partner shall be treated as having received all distributions (whether before or upon liquidation) unreduced by the amount of such Tax Advance. To the fullest extent permitted by law, each Partner hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Partnership and the other Partners from and against any liability (including, without limitation, any liability for taxes, penalties, additions to tax or interest) with respect to income attributable to or distributions or other payments to such Partner. A Partner's obligation to pay or indemnify for a tax or payment (and related interest and penalties) shall survive the Partner selling or otherwise disposing of its interest in the Partnership and the termination, dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the Partnership.
       - Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the General Partner may receive a cash advance against distributions of Carried Interest to the extent that distributions of Carried Interest actually received by the General Partner during a fiscal period are not sufficient for the General Partner or any of its partners or beneficial owners (whether their interests in the General Partner are held directly or indirectly) to pay when due any income tax (including estimated income tax) imposed on it or them during such fiscal period (or any prior fiscal period), as applicable, with respect to allocations or distributions relating to Carried Interest, calculated using the Combined Tax Rate and taking into account any carryover of Partnership capital losses for prior period to the extent such losses would be deductible in determining the General Partner's tax liability for such period, determined taking into account only the General Partner, as applicable, items of income, gain, loss and deduction attributable to the Partnership. Amounts advanced pursuant to this <u>Section 10.6(b)</u> shall be treated as repaid from subsequent distributions under <u>Section 3.4</u>.
       - If requested by the General Partner, each Partner shall, if able to do so, deliver to the General Partner: (x) an affidavit in form satisfactory to the General Partner that the applicable Partner (or its direct or indirect owners, as the case may be) is not subject to withholding under the provisions of any federal, state, local, foreign or other law; (y) any certificate or other document that the General Partner may reasonably request with respect to any such laws, including any form, certification, or other information required by Section 1471-1474 of the Code (and the Regulations or other authority promulgated thereunder); and/or (z) any other form or instrument reasonably requested by the General Partner relating to any Partner's status under such laws. If a Limited Partner fails or is unable to deliver to the General Partner an affidavit described in subclause (x) or certificate or other documentation described in subclause (y) or (z) of this <u>Section 10.6(c)</u>, the General Partner may withhold amounts from such Limited Partner in accordance with <u>Section 10.6(a)</u>, and such Partner acknowledges that it may be subject to the provisions of <u>Section 3.3(e)</u>.

1. <center>[clause="miscellaneous"]**MISCELLANEOUS**</center>
    1. **<u>Waiver of Partition and Accounting**</u>. Except as may be otherwise required by law, each Partner hereby irrevocably waives any and all rights that it may have to maintain an action for an accounting or for partition or any similar action of any of the Partnership's property.
    1. **<u>Confidentiality**</u>.
       - Each Limited Partner will maintain the confidentiality and not disclose information which is nonpublic information furnished by the General Partner regarding the General Partner and/or the Partnership (including information regarding any Portfolio Investment that the Partnership holds or contemplates acquiring) received by such Limited Partner (including, without limitation, in connection with any meeting of the Partners), except (i) as otherwise required by governmental regulatory agencies (including tax authorities in connection with an audit or other similar examination of such Limited Partner), law or legal process (provided that any disclosure that is either (A) not to such a governmental regulatory agency or (B) not on a confidential basis, shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, require prior written notice thereof to the General Partner) or (ii) to directors, employees, representatives and advisors of such Limited Partner and its Affiliate(s), if any, who need to know the information and who are informed of the confidential nature of the information and agree to keep it confidential. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Limited Partner acknowledges that notices and reports to Limited Partners (including, without limitation, any information provided in connection with any meeting of the Partners) may contain material nonpublic information concerning, among other things, the Portfolio Company and agrees not to use such information other than in connection with monitoring its investment in the Partnership and agrees in that regard not to trade in securities on the basis of any such information.
       - Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 11.2(a) above, the General Partner agrees that each Limited Partner that (i) itself is an investment partnership or other collective investment vehicle having reporting obligations to its limited partners or other investors and (ii) has prior to the closing of its subscription for Interests notified the General Partner in writing that it is electing the benefits of this <u>Section 11.2(b)</u> may, in order to satisfy each of their respective reporting obligations, provide on a confidential basis the following information to such Persons regarding the Partnership and the Portfolio Company: (A) the cost of the Partnership’s investment in the Portfolio Company and the percentage interest of the Portfolio Company acquired by the Partnership (but not the current value of such investment in the Portfolio Company), (B) a description of the business of the Portfolio Company and information regarding the industry and geographic location of the Portfolio Company, (C) the book value of the Portfolio Company on the last day of the quarter, (D) a brief description of the investment strategy of the Partnership, and (E) the name and address of the Partnership. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event may any such Limited Partner disclose any other confidential information regarding the Partnership, the General Partner or any information regarding the Partnership’s pending acquisition or pending disposition of a Portfolio Investment without the prior written consent of the General Partner.
       - Notwithstanding the obligation of confidentiality set out in this <u>Section 11.2</u>, to comply with Treasury Regulations Section 1.601l-4(b)(3)(i), each Limited Partner (and any employee, representative, or other agent of such Limited Partner) may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the U.S. federal income tax treatment and tax structure of the Partnership or any transactions contemplated by the Partnership under this Agreement. However, any such information relating to the tax treatment or tax structure is required to be kept confidential to the extent necessary to comply with any applicable federal or state securities laws. For purposes of the two preceding sentences, tax treatment and tax structure shall not include, and such Limited Partner (or employee, representative or agent thereof) shall not disclose (i) the name of, or any other identifying information regarding, the Partnership or any existing or future investor (or any Affiliate thereof) in the Partnership, or any investment or transaction entered into by the Partnership and any information regarding the specific economic terms of the Partnership (including, without limitation, the amount of any fees and the percentages used in calculating Carried Interest), (ii) any performance information relating to the Partnership or its investments, or (iii) any performance or other information relating to other funds or investments sponsored or managed by the General Partner or its Affiliate(s), if any.
       - In order to preserve the confidentiality of certain information disseminated by the General Partner or the Partnership under this Agreement that a Limited Partner is entitled to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement (or in situations where the General Partner determines in good faith that a Limited Partner has violated or is reasonably likely to violate the confidentiality provisions of this Agreement), including, but not limited to, quarterly, annual and other reports (other than the IRS Form 1065 and Schedule K-l, and information provided at the Partnership's informational meetings, the General Partner or any of its Affiliate(s), if any, may (i) provide to such Limited Partner access to such information only on a website maintained by the General Partner or its Affiliate(s), if any, in password protected, non-downloadable, non-printable format, and/or (ii) require such Limited Partner to return any copies of information provided to it by the General Partner or the Partnership, subject to <u>Section 11.2(c)</u>.
       - To the extent that the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552, ("FOIA"), any state public records access law, any state or other jurisdiction's laws similar in intent or effect to FOIA, or any other similar statutory or regulatory requirement would potentially cause a Limited Partner or any of its Affiliate(s), if any, to disclose information relating to the Partnership, its Affiliate(s), if any, and/or the Portfolio Company, such Limited Partner hereby agrees that, in addition to compliance with the notice requirements set forth in <u>Section 11.2(a)</u> above, such Limited Partner (x) shall take commercially reasonable steps to oppose and prevent the requested disclosure unless (i) the General Partner does not object in writing to such disclosure within ten (10) Business Days (or such lesser time period as stipulated by the applicable law) of such notice or (ii) such disclosure solely relates to fund level, aggregate performance information (i.e., aggregate cash flows, overall "IRRs," the year of formation of the Partnership, and such Limited Partner's own Capital Contribution) and does not include (A) any information relating to the Portfolio Company, (B) copies of this Agreement and related documents or (C) any other information not referred to in clause (ii) above, and (y) acknowledges and agrees that notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the General Partner may, in order to prevent any such potential disclosure that the General Partner determines in good faith is likely to occur, withhold all or any part of the information otherwise to be provided to such Limited Partner other than the fund level, aggregate performance information specified in clause (ii) above and the IRS Form 1065 and Schedule K-l.
       - Any obligation of a Limited Partner pursuant to this <u>Section 11.2</u> may be waived by the General Partner in its sole discretion.
       - A Limited Partner may by giving written notice to the General Partner elect not to receive copies of any document, report or other information that such Limited Partner would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this Agreement and is not required by applicable law to be delivered. The General Partner agrees that it shall make any such documents available to such Limited Partner at the General Partner's offices (or, at the request of such Limited Partner, the offices of counsel to the Partnership) on terms and conditions set forth in </u>Section 7.1</u>.
    1. **<u>Power of Attorney**</u>. Each Limited Partner hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the General Partner, with full power of substitution, the true and lawful attorney-in-fact and agent of such Limited Partner, to execute, acknowledge, verify, swear to, deliver, record and file, in its or its assignee's name, place and stead, all in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, all instruments, documents and certificates which may from time to time be required by the laws of the United States of America, the State of Delaware, any other jurisdiction in which the Partnership conducts or plans to conduct its affairs, or any political subdivision or agency thereof to effectuate, implement and continue the valid existence and affairs of the Partnership, including, without limitation, the power and authority to execute, verify, swear to, acknowledge, deliver, record and file:

      Such attorney-in-fact and agent shall not, however, have the right, power or authority to amend or modify this Agreement when acting in such capacities, except to the extent authorized herein.

       - The General Partner shall have the right to amend this Agreement without the approval of any other Partner to the extent the General Partner reasonably determines, based upon written advice of tax counsel to the Partnership, that the amendment is necessary to provide assurance that the Partnership will not be treated as a "publicly traded partnership" under Section 7704 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder; provided that (i) such amendment shall not change the relative economic interests of the Partners, reduce any Partner's share of distributions, or increase its liability hereunder, (ii) the General Partner provides a copy of such written advice and amendment to the Limited Partners at least twenty (20) days prior to the effective date of any such amendment and (iii) a Majority in Interest of the Limited Partners shall not have made a reasonable objection to such amendment prior to the effective date of such amendment.

The representations and warranties of the Limited Partners in, and the other provisions of, the Subscription Documents shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement.
    1. **<u>Severability**</u>.

    1. **<u>Governing Law and Jurisdiction**</u>
       - Notwithstanding the place where this Agreement may be executed by any of the parties thereto, the parties expressly agree that all the terms and provisions hereof shall be construed under the laws of the State of Delaware and, without limitation thereof, that the Act as now adopted or as may be hereafter amended shall govern the partnership aspects of this Agreement.
       - Any legal disagreement, dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the interpretation hereof, the relationship contemplated hereby, or the breach, termination or invalidity hereof shall be finally resolved by arbitration in Dover, Delaware conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Arbitration under this <u>Section 11.8</u> shall be initiated by written demand for arbitration specifying the controversy or claim on which arbitration is sought, as well as the relief requested. Arbitration shall be before a panel of one arbitrator, who shall be selected by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the extent practical within fifteen (15) Business Days following receipt by the respondent of the demand to arbitrate. The arbitrator shall render its decision to the parties in writing together with the underlying reasoning, including separate statements of findings of facts and conclusions of law, no later than sixty (60) days after completion of hearings, but in no event later than one hundred and eighty (180) days from the date of appointment of the arbitrator. The parties agree to use all commercially reasonable efforts to assure that the arbitration procedure set forth herein, once commenced, shall be completed as expeditiously as possible. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the parties and judgment upon the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. This arbitration agreement is intended to be self-executing. The expenses of arbitration shall be borne by the party against whom the decision is rendered, or apportioned in accordance with the decision of the arbitrators in the event of a compromise decision. All notices from one party to the other relating to any arbitration hereunder shall be in writing and shall be effective if given in accordance with the provisions of /u>Section 11.7</u>. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the arbitration provisions set forth herein, and any arbitration conducted thereunder, shall be governed exclusively by the Federal Arbitration Act, Title 9, United States Code and by the 1958 United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, to the exclusion of any state or municipal law of arbitration.
       - Notwithstanding anything contained in <u>Section 11.8(b)</u>, any party shall have the right to institute judicial proceedings against another party or any Person acting by, through or under such party in order to enforce the instituting party's rights hereunder through specific performance, injunction or similar equitable relief. Each party hereby submits to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware located in New Castle County for purposes thereof. Each party hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such courts and any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such courts has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each party hereby consents to process being served in any such suit, action or proceeding by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to its address designated in accordance with <u>Section 11.7</u>. Each party hereby agrees that such service (x) shall be deemed in every respect effective service of process upon it in any such suit, action or proceeding and (y) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be taken and held to be valid personal service upon and personal delivery to it.
    1. **<u>Successors and Assigns**</u>. Except with respect to the rights of Protected Persons hereunder, none of the provisions of this Agreement shall be for the benefit of or enforceable by Persons not party to this Agreement (including the creditors of the Partnership or the General Partner) and this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Partners and their legal representatives, heirs, successors and permitted assigns.
    1. **<u>Counterparts**</u>. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument.
    1. **<u>Interpretation**</u>. Wherever from the context it appears appropriate, each term stated in either the singular or the plural shall include the singular and the plural, and pronouns stated in either the masculine or the neuter gender shall include the masculine, the feminine and the neuter. The words "include," "includes" and "including" shall be deemed to be followed by the phrase "without limitation" to the extent such words are not already so qualified. This Agreement shall not be construed against any party by reason of that party having caused this Agreement to be drafted. The words "hereof, "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. To the fullest extent permitted by law and notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or in any agreement contemplated herein or applicable provisions or law or equity or otherwise, whenever in this Agreement a Person is permitted or required to make a decision in its "good faith" or under another express standard, such Person shall act under such express standard and shall not be subject to any other or different standards.
    1. **<u>Headings; Internal References**</u>. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, Annexes, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section, Annex, Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, index of defined terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience and reference purposes only and shall not be deemed to alter or affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of any provisions of this Agreement. The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
    1. **<u>Partnership Status**</u>. The Partnership shall be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and no election to the contrary shall be made.
    1. **<u>Counsel to the Partnership**</u>. Counsel to the Partnership may also be counsel to the General Partner. The General Partner may execute on behalf of the Partnership and the Partners any consent to the representation of the Partnership that counsel may request pursuant to the applicable rules of professional conduct in any jurisdiction ("Rules"). The Partnership may, at the General Partner's sole discretion, select legal counsel (the "Partnership Counsel") to the Partnership. Each Limited Partner acknowledges that the Partnership Counsel does not represent any Limited Partner in the absence of a clear and explicit agreement to such effect between the Limited Partner and the Partnership Counsel (and then only to the extent specifically set forth in that agreement), and that in the absence of any such agreement the Partnership Counsel shall owe no duties directly to a Limited Partner. In the event any dispute or controversy arises between any Limited Partner and the Partnership, or between any Limited Partner or the Partnership, on the one hand, and the General Partner that the Partnership Counsel represents, on the other hand, then each Limited Partner agrees that the Partnership Counsel may represent either the Partnership, the General Partner, or each of them, in any such dispute or controversy to the extent permitted by the Rules, and each Limited Partner hereby consents to such representation. Each Limited Partner further acknowledges that the Partnership Counsel has not represented the interest of any Limited Partner in the preparation and negotiation of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all or any portion of the foregoing shall not apply to a Limited Partner to the extent that the foregoing is inconsistent with an established policy of a Limited Partner that is an institutional investor, and such Limited Partner notifies the General Partner of such policy in writing prior to such Limited Partner's admission to the Partnership.
    1. **<u>Force Majeure**</u>. Whenever any act or thing is required of the Partnership, the General Partner or its Affiliate(s), if any, or the Administrator hereunder to be done within any specified period of time, the Partnership, the General Partner or its Affiliate(s), if any, or the Administrator, as the case may be, shall be entitled to such additional period of time to do such act or thing as shall equal any period of delay resulting from causes beyond the reasonable control of the Partnership, the General Partner or its Affiliate(s), if any, or the Administrator, as the case may be; provided that this provision shall not have the effect of permanently relieving the Partnership, the General Partner or its Affiliate(s), if any, or the Administrator from the obligation to perform any such act or thing.
    1. **<u>Waiver**</u>. No waiver of the provisions hereof shall be valid unless in writing and signed by the party to be bound and then only to the extent therein set forth. Except as specifically herein provided, no failure or delay by any party in exercising any right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, and a waiver of a particular right or remedy on one occasion shall not be deemed a waiver of any other right or remedy or a waiver on any subsequent occasion.
