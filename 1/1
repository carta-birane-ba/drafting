However, for purposes of discussing and voting on any action under this Operating Agreement, the Members shall meet at the principal executive office of the Company. Alternatively, the Members may discuss and vote on any action through use of telephones or similar communications equipment, provided that the Members can communicate with and hear each other.
   1. **Meetings; Notice**.

      - Meetings of the Members to discuss and vote on any action or for any purpose or purposes, may be called at any time by any Member. Notice of the time and place of meetings shall be delivered personally; by electronic mail; or by first-class mail, charges prepaid, and addressed to the other Members at their respective addresses as they appear in the records of the Company. In case such notice is mailed, it shall be deposited in the United States mail at least five (5) Business Days prior to the time of the holding of the meeting. In case such notice is delivered personally, by electronic mail, it shall be so delivered at least three (3) Business Day prior to the time of the meeting. The notice need not specify the purpose of the meeting.
      - Only Persons whose names are listed as Members on the records of the Company at the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the day on which notice of the meeting is given or, if such notice is waived, at the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the day on which the meeting is held (except that the record date for Members entitled to give consent to action without a meeting shall be determined in accordance with Section 4.13) shall be entitled to receive notice of and to vote at such meeting, and such day shall be the record date for such meeting. Any such vote may be _viva voce _or by ballot.

   1. **Quorum**. The presence at any meeting in person or by proxy of a Majority in Interest of the Members shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at such meeting. The Members present at a duly called or held meeting at which a quorum is present may not continue to transact business (other than to call for and to adjourn such meeting), from and after the time of the withdrawal of a sufficient number of Members to leave less than a quorum.
   1. **Waiver of Notice**. The actions of any meeting of Members, however called and noticed, and wherever held, shall be as valid as if taken at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum be present either in person or by proxy, and if, either before or after the meeting, each person entitled to vote, not present in person or by proxy, signs a written waiver of notice or a consent to a holding of the meeting, or an approval of the minutes thereof. The waiver of notice, consent or approval need not specify either the business to be transacted or the purpose of any regular or special meeting of Members. All such waivers, consents or approvals shall be filed with the Company records and made a part of the minutes of the meeting. Attendance of a Member at a meeting shall also constitute a waiver of notice of and presence at such meeting, except when the Member expressly objects to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened, and except that attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the consideration of matters required to be included in the notice but not so included, if such objection is expressly made at the meeting.
   1. **Action by Members without a Meeting**. Any action which, under any provision of the Act or this Operating Agreement, may be taken at a meeting of the Members, may be taken without a meeting, and without notice except as hereinafter set forth, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, is signed by the Member or Members having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all Members entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. All such consents shall be filed with the Company and shall be maintained in the Company's records. Unless the consents of all Members entitled to vote have been solicited in writing, prompt notice shall be given of the taking of any action approved by the Members without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent to those Members entitled to vote who have not consented in writing. The record date for such determination shall be the day on which the first written consent is given. Any Member giving a written consent, or the Member's proxyholders, or a personal representative of the Member or their respective proxyholders, may revoke the consent by a writing received by the Managers prior to the time that written consents of the number of votes required to authorize the proposed action have been filed with the Managers, but may not do so thereafter. Such revocation is effective upon its receipt by the Managers.
   1. **Members May Participate in Other Activities**. This Operating Agreement shall not prevent any Member, either individually or with others, from participating in other business activities and ventures of any kind. No Member, acting in the capacity of a Member, shall be obligated to offer to the Company or to the other Member any opportunity to participate in any such other business activity or venture. Neither the Company nor any Member shall have any right to any income or profit derived from any such other business activity or venture of a Member.
   1. **Confidentiality**. Each Member agrees not to disclose, communicate, use to the detriment of the Company or any of its Affiliates, or for the benefit of any other Person, or misuse in any way any confidential information or trade secrets of the Company, including without limitation processes, techniques, research, analysis and/or other proprietary information developed by or on behalf of the Company by a Member or otherwise, customer, investor or client lists or other information, marketing plans, pricing, formulas, and other data. Nothing in this Section 4.15 shall affect the rights of a Member with respect to any information of the Company after it becomes generally available to the public for reasons other than such Member's breach of this Section 4.15 or to disclose information in accordance with the requirements of any applicable law or court or administrative order. The Members acknowledge and agree that damages would not adequately compensate the Company if the representations contained in this Section 4.15 were breached by a Member. Consequently, notwithstanding Section 10.9, each Member agrees that in the event of any such breach, the Company shall be entitled to enforce any or all of the representations contained in this Section 4.15 by an injunction or other equitable relief, in addition to (and not in limitation of) any other remedies, and without being required to post any bond or other security.
   1. **Removal of a Member**. The Managers may remove a Member subject to Section 6.3(a).  If a Member is removed, such removed Member's Interest shall be purchased by the Company and/or one or more of the remaining Members for an amount equal to the Liquidation Share of the removed Member's Interest as of the date on which it is purchased.

1. [clause="allocations"]**ALLOCATIONS OF NET PROFIT AND NET LOSS AND DISTRIBUTIONS**

   1. **Allocations of Net Profits and Net Losses.  **Net Profits and Net Losses for each taxable year (or other relevant period) shall, except as otherwise required by Section 7.3 or the Code and the Treasury Regulations, be allocated amongst the Members for such taxable year (or other relevant period) so as to produce, as nearly as possible, an Adjusted Capital Account balance for each Member (determined without regard to reductions for distributions made to the Member during the taxable year (or other relevant period)) equal to the following:

      -  the sum of the cash and fair market value of property actually distributed to the Member within such taxable year (or other relevant period), _plus_
      -  the hypothetical cash that would be distributed to such Member if: (1) each of the Company's assets were sold for an amount of hypothetical cash equal to the sum of (A) the "book values" of the assets (as determined in accordance with Treasury Regulation issued under Code Section 704) at the end of such taxable year (or other relevant period), <u>plus</u> (B) the aggregate "partnership minimum gain" and "partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain (each, as determined in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2) at the end of such taxable year (or other relevant period); (2) the Company paid all of its liabilities in accordance with their terms up to the amount of the hypothetical cash; and (3) the remaining hypothetical cash from such deemed sale were immediately distributed under Section 7.2.

   1. **Distributions by the Company**.

      - Subject to the reasonably anticipated business needs and opportunities of the Company and to any restrictions under applicable law (including, without limitation, any obligation to withhold and remit any amounts to any governmental authority), the Managers shall resolve from time to time to distribute cash or other property, including cash or other property attributable to any Carried Interest and/or Management Fees, to the Members in proportion to their Percentage Ownership.
      - To the extent the Managers reasonably determine that the Company is required by law to withhold or to make tax or any other payments on behalf of or with respect to any Member (or direct or indirect shareholder, member, or other owner of such Member), including withholding taxes, and state unincorporated business taxes, and payments pursuant to the Revised Partnership Audit Provisions ("<u>Tax Advances</u>"), the Managers may withhold such amounts and make such tax payments as so required.  All Tax Advances made on behalf of a Member shall, in the sole discretion of the Managers, (i) be promptly paid to the Company by the Member on whose behalf such Tax Advances were made or (ii) be repaid by reducing the amount of the current or next succeeding distribution or distributions which would otherwise have been made to such Member or, if such distributions are not sufficient for that purpose, by so reducing the proceeds of liquidation otherwise payable to such Member. Whenever the Managers select option (ii) pursuant to the preceding sentence for repayment of a Tax Advance by a Member, for all other purposes of this Agreement such Member shall be treated as having received all distributions (whether before or upon liquidation) unreduced by the amount of such Tax Advance. To the fullest extent permitted by law, each Member hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the other Members from and against any liability (including, without limitation, any liability for taxes, penalties, additions to tax or interest) with respect to income attributable to or distributions or other payments to such Member.  A Member's obligation to pay or indemnify for a tax or payment (and related interest and penalties) shall survive the Member selling or otherwise disposing of its interest in the Company and the termination, dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the Company.

   1. **Regulatory Allocations**. The provisions of the Treasury Regulations relating to "qualified income offsets," "minimum gain chargebacks" and "partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain chargebacks" are all hereby incorporated by reference. All "nonrecourse deductions" within the meaning of the Treasury Regulations shall be allocated in accordance with Section 7.1. All "partner nonrecourse deductions" within the meaning of the Treasury Regulations shall be allocated to the Member who bears the economic risk of loss, determined in accordance with Section 1.704-2 and 1.752-2 of the Treasury Regulations, for the partner nonrecourse liability giving rise to such partner nonrecourse deductions.  Net Losses allocated pursuant to Section 7.1 shall not exceed the maximum amount of Net Losses that can be so allocated without causing a Member to have a deficit balance in such Member's Capital Account at the end of any fiscal year in excess of such Member's obligation to restore such amount (including any deemed obligations pursuant to the Treasury Regulations). All such items of Net Loss in excess of the limitation set forth in the prior sentence shall be allocated to Members not so restricted, pro rata, in proportion to the amounts they may be so allocated without violating such restriction. Any allocations made pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.3 ("<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Regulatory Allocations</span>") shall be taken into account in computing subsequent allocations pursuant to this Section 7.3 and Section 7.1 so that, to the maximum extent possible, the net amount of all such allocations shall be equal to what they would have been had this Section 7.3 not been part of this Operating Agreement; provided, that Regulatory Allocations that have not yet been made, but are likely to be made in the future, shall be taken into account in computing such subsequent allocations.
   1. **Tax Allocations; Code Section 704(c) Allocations**. Except as otherwise provide in this Section 7.4, all items of income, gain and loss for federal and state income tax purposes shall be allocated in accordance with the corresponding "book" income, gain and loss. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Article VII, in accordance with Code Section 704(c) and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, items of income, gain, loss, and deduction with respect to any property of the Company shall, solely for tax purposes, be allocated among the Members so as to take account of any variation between the adjusted basis of such property to the Company for federal income tax purposes and its "book" value for purposes of maintaining Capital Accounts. Allocations pursuant to this Section 7.4 are solely for purposes of federal, state and local taxes. As such, they shall not affect or in any way be taken into account in computing a Member's Capital Account or share of Net Profit, Net Loss, or other items or distributions pursuant to any provisions of this Operating Agreement.
   1. **Other Allocation Rules.  **If all or any portion of an Interest is Transferred during any fiscal year of the Company (or other relevant period), each item of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit of the Company for such fiscal year (or other relevant period) allocable to the holder of such Interest for such fiscal year shall be allocated between such holder and its transferee in accordance with Code Section 706 using any convention permitted by Code Section 706 and selected by the Manager.
   1. **Deficit Capital Accounts**. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Operating Agreement, and notwithstanding any custom or rule of law to the contrary, no Member shall be required to restore any deficit balance in such Member's Capital Account upon dissolution of the Company or otherwise, such deficit shall not be an asset of the Company and such Member shall not be obligated to contribute such amount to the Company to bring the balance of such Member's Capital Account to zero.

   <center>###**Article VIII**</center>

1. [clause="books"]**BOOKS AND RECORDS**

      - Copies of the federal, state and local information or income tax returns for each of the Company's six (6) most recent tax years (or such shorter period that the Company has been in existence);
      - A copy of the Certificate and this Operating Agreement, all amendments or restatements thereof, executed copies of any powers of attorney, and copies of any document that creates, in the manner provided by the Certificate or this Operating Agreement, classes or groups of Members;
      - Correct and complete books and records of account of the Company; and
      - Any other books, records or documents required by this Operating Agreement, the Certificate, the Act or other applicable law.

   1. **Returns and Other Elections**. The Managers will cause the preparation and timely filing of all tax returns required to be filed by the Company pursuant to the Code and all other tax returns deemed necessary and required in each jurisdiction in which the Company does business. Copies of the returns, or pertinent information therefrom, shall be furnished to the Members within one hundred and twenty (120) days after the end of each fiscal year. All elections permitted to be made by the Company under federal or state laws will be made by the Managers.
   1. **Partnership Representative**. {{carta.partnership_representative}} is hereby authorized to take the actions ultimately required to be designated as a "partnership representative" (or to designate an individual to act as partnership representative) for purposes of the Revised Partnership Audit Provisions, and to take any and all actions that the "partnership representative" is authorized to take with respect to taxable years of the Company to which the Revised Partnership Audit Provisions apply. The "partnership representative" will inform the other Member of all significant matters that may come to its attention in its capacity as "partnership representative," as applicable, by giving notice thereof on or before seven (7) days after becoming aware thereof and, within that time, will forward to the other Member copies of all significant written communications it may receive in that capacity.  The partnership representative shall use its reasonable efforts to apply the rules and elections under the Revised Partnership Audit Provisions so that no Member will bear any material tax as a result of any audit or proceeding that is attributable to another Member (other than a predecessor in interest). The partnership representative is hereby authorized to take any action required or permitted (including, at the reasonable discretion of the partnership representative, making an election under Section 6226 of the Code) to cause the financial burden of any "imputed underpayment" (as determined under Section 6225 of the Code) and associated interest, adjustments to tax and penalties arising from a partnership-level adjustment that are imposed on the Company, and the cost of contesting any such partnership-level adjustment, to be borne by the Members and former Members to whom such imputed underpayment relates as determined by the partnership representative after consulting with the Company's accountants or other advisers, taking into account any differences in the amount of taxes attributable to each Member because of such Member's status. All Members (and former Members) agree to cooperate with, and to take all reasonable actions requested by the partnership representative and the Company, to avoid or reduce any tax imposed under Section 6225 of the Code, including cooperating with any election under Section 6226 of the Code, or to otherwise allow the Company and the partnership representative to comply with the Revised Partnership Audit Provisions. The obligations of a Member under this Section 8.3 shall survive a Member's sale or other disposition of its interests in the Company and the termination, dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the Company.
   1. **Delivery of Reports**. If requested by a Majority in Interest of the Members, the Managers shall deliver the following reports to the Members as provided herein:

      - *Interim Financial Reports.* Within thirty (30) days of the end of each calendar quarter, the Managers shall deliver to the Members an income statement, balance sheet and statement of cash flows for such calendar quarter and for the year-to-date, calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
      - *Annual Financial Statements.* Within ninety (90) days of the end of each calendar year, the Managers shall deliver to the Members the annual financial statements prepared by an independent certified public accountant in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

   <center>###**Article IX**</center>

1. [clause="dissolution"]**DISSOLUTION AND WINDING UP**

   1. **Dissolution**. The Company will be dissolved and its affairs will be wound up upon the first to occur of the following:

      - A decision by the Managers to dissolve the Company, subject to Section 6.3(b);
      - On the death, retirement, resignation, expulsion, legal incapacity, dissolution or bankruptcy of all of the Managers, unless the Members appoint a new Manager or Managers and elect to continue the business of the Company;
      - The entry of a decree of judicial dissolution under the Act;
      - A Deadlock is not resolved by the Members within ninety (90) days of the date on which they are provided written notice of the Deadlock; and
      - The Act so requires and the requirement is not validly varied by the Certificate or this Operating Agreement.

      - On dissolution of the Company, the business and affairs of the Company will terminate, and the assets of the Company will be liquidated and the Company's affairs will be wound up under this Article IX.

The Members shall continue to share in Net Profits and Net Losses as provided for in Article VII during the dissolution process.

   1. **Distribution of Assets on Dissolution**. In settling accounts after dissolution, the assets of the Company will be paid in the following order:

   1. **Distributions in Kind**.

If distributions in kind are made to the Members on dissolution and winding up of the Company, the Capital Account balances of those Members will be adjusted to reflect the Members' allocable share of gain or loss that would have resulted if the distributed property had been sold at its fair market value.
   1. **Certificate of Cancellation**. When all liabilities and obligations of the Company have been paid or discharged, or adequate provision has been made therefor, and all of the remaining property and assets of the Company, if any, have been distributed to the Members according to their respective rights and interests, a certificate of cancellation shall be executed on behalf of the Company by the Managers or an authorized Member and shall be filed with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, and the Members shall execute, acknowledge and file any and all other instruments necessary or appropriate to reflect the dissolution and the completion of the winding up of the Company.
