If the Subscription Documents require Members to make all of their Capital Contributions on or before the date of the closing in which they are admitted to the Company, then the Payment Date shall be the applicable closing. If the Subscription Documents require Members to make their Capital Contributions pursuant to one or more Payment Notices, then the Payment Date shall be specified in the Payment Notice delivered by the Manager to each Member, provided that the Payment Date with respect to the initial Payment Notice shall be at least three (3) Business Days after the date of the delivery of such Payment Notice and the Payment Date with respect to any subsequent Payment Notice shall be at least ten (10) Business Days after the date of delivery of such Payment Notice.
                - A "<u>Payment Notice</u>" shall mean a written notice requiring Capital Contributions to the Company, which notice shall:

                         (A)  specify the purpose for which the Capital Contributions are required to be made; and
	                  	   (B)  specify each Member's Capital Contributions required to be made by such Member.
               -  The "<u>Initial Payment Date</u>" shall mean the first date on which Members shall be required to make Capital Contributions.
            - With respect to each Member, Capital Contributions shall be made in U.S. dollars by wire transfer or check of immediately available funds to the account specified in the related Payment Notice.
				  - Other than as set forth in this Article III, no Member shall be entitled to any interest or compensation by reason of its Capital Contributions or by reason of serving as a Member. No Member shall be required to lend any funds to the Company.
            - The Manager shall cause the books and records of the Company to be amended from time to time to reflect the names and addresses of Members and changes thereto and the transfer of Interests and changes in Capital Contributions which are accomplished in accordance with the provisions hereof.
            - If the Manager determines that a proposed Portfolio Investment in respect of which Members have made Principal Capital Contributions will not be consummated, the Manager shall refund to the Members which made such Principal Capital Contributions the amounts of such Principal Capital Contributions (together with any earnings thereon). If the Manager determines that a proposed Portfolio Investment in respect of which Members have made Principal Capital Contributions will not require the full amount of Principal Capital Contributions made therefor, the Manager shall refund to the Members which made such Principal Capital Contributions, *pro rata* to the amounts of such Principal Capital Contributions, the amount of such Principal Capital Contributions which exceeds the portion required to consummate such Portfolio Investment (together with any earnings thereon). Any amount refunded pursuant to this Section 3.1(f) shall be treated for purposes of Section 3.4(a) as never having been contributed to the Company. Any amounts to be refunded pursuant to this Section 3.1(f) shall be refunded to the Members at such times and intervals as the Manager shall determine, in its sole discretion, but in no event later than (i) ninety (90) days from the applicable Payment Date and (ii) ten (10) Business Days after the termination of any binding commitment to fund such Portfolio Investment.
   1. **<u>Subsequent Closings</u>**
      - <u>Generally</u>. The Manager may, in its sole discretion, admit additional Members, or permit any existing Member to increase its Principal Capital Contributions, at one or more subsequent closings for up to six (6) months after the Initial Payment Date ("Subsequent Closings").
		- Principal Capital Contributions for Portfolio Investments at Subsequent Closings</u>. Each Member that is admitted or increases its Principal Capital Contribution at a Subsequent Closing shall make a Principal Capital Contribution to the Company in respect of a Follow-On Portfolio Investment to be made by the Company and not in respect of a pre-existing Portfolio Investment.
      - An existing Member whose Principal Capital Contribution is increased pursuant to clause (a) above shall be treated, for purposes of <u>Section 3.2</u>, as two Members, one being an additional Member that is admitted with a Principal Capital Contribution equal to such increase as of the Subsequent Closing date upon which such increase occurred and the other being an existing Member with a Principal Capital Contribution that is not increased.
   1. **<u>Distributions-General Principles.</u>**
      - <u>Generally</u>. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Article III or in Articles VIII and IX, no Member shall have the right to withdraw capital from the Company or to receive any distribution or return of its Capital Contribution. Distributions of Company assets that are provided for in this Article III or in Articles VIII and IX shall be made only to Persons who, according to the books and records of the Company, were the holders of record of Interests in the Company on the date determined by the Manager as of which the Members are entitled to any such distributions. It is generally expected that the Company will distribute cash or marketable securities in respect of all of the Portfolio Investments upon an initial public offering of the Portfolio Company or following an acquisition of the Portfolio Company. Any income generated by a Portfolio Investment shall be accrued until the Disposition of such Portfolio Investment.
      - <u>Timing of Distributions</u>. Disposition Proceeds from a Portfolio Investment, and any accrued income associated therewith, shall be distributed as soon as practicable after receipt thereof but in any event within ninety (90) days after the date such Disposition Proceeds are received by the Company; provided that, in the case of any Portfolio Investment that is Disposed of in a series of related transactions, the Manager shall not be required to distribute any Disposition Proceeds from such Portfolio Investment until the entire Portfolio Investment has been Disposed of.
      - For all purposes of this Agreement, whenever a portion of a Portfolio Investment (but not the entire Portfolio Investment) is the subject of a Disposition, that portion may be treated as having been a separate Portfolio Investment from the portion of the Portfolio Investment that is retained by the Company, and any accrued income and Principal Capital Contributions for Portfolio Investment may be treated as having been divided between the sold portion and the retained portion on a pro rata basis based on either the respective values of the portions of the Portfolio Investment immediately prior to such Disposition or such other method of allocation as the Manager determines in good faith more accurately reflects the appropriate allocation of such amounts.
      - For all purposes of this Agreement, whenever a new investment is made, such subsequent investment shall be treated as a separate Portfolio Investment from the Portfolio Investments previously made, and Principal Capital Contributions for, and Disposition Proceeds and Carried Interest proceeds subsequently received in respect of all such investment shall, to the extent the Manager determines in its sole discretion is practicable, be allocated on a specific identification basis or such other basis as the Manager may determine appropriate in its good faith discretion.
      - The amount of any taxes paid by or withheld from receipts of the Company allocable to a Member from a Portfolio Investment shall be deemed to have been distributed to such Member as Disposition Proceeds to the extent that the payment or withholding of such taxes reduced Disposition Proceeds otherwise distributable to such Member as provided herein. For this purpose, such taxes shall be allocated among the Members proportionately based on their relative shares of the income or gain in question (and assuming that no such taxes have been paid or withheld); provided, however, that if any such taxes are imposed on or with respect to one or more, but not all of the Members in the Company, the amount of the reduction shall be borne by the relevant Members and treated as if it were paid by the Company as a Tax Advance with respect to such Members pursuant to </u>Section 10.6(a)</u> for all purposes of this Agreement.

   1. **<u>Amounts and Priority of Distributions.</u>**
      - <u>Distributions of Disposition Proceeds</u>. Each distribution of Disposition Proceeds from a Portfolio Investment shall initially be apportioned to the Members (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Manager (and/or its Affiliate(s), if applicable)) pro rata in proportion to each of their respective Percentage Interests with respect to such Portfolio Investment. The amount apportioned to the Manager (and/or its Affiliate(s), if applicable) will be distributed to the Manager (and/or such Affiliate(s), as applicable). The amount initially apportioned to a Member (other than the Manager and/or its Affiliate(s), if applicable), shall be further divided between such Member on the one hand and the Manager on the other hand as follows:
         - First, 100% to such Member until such Member has received cumulative distributions of Disposition Proceeds (including for this purpose amounts deemed distributed to a Member pursuant to this Agreement) in an amount equal to such Member’s Principal Capital Contributions, after taking into account distributions returned by such Member pursuant to <u>Section 5.2(b)</u>; and  
        
			- {% if carta.premium_carry_percentage_primary == null %}Thereafter, {{(carta.lp_carried_interest * 100) | round(2)}}% to the Member and {{(carta.gp_carried_interest * 100) | round(2)}}% to the Manager.] {% else %}Second,
        
             (A) if such Member has received cumulative distributions of Disposition Proceeds (including for this purpose amounts deemed distributed to a Member pursuant to this Agreement) pursuant to this <u>Section 3.4(a)(ii)</u> that are less than {{(carta.premium_carry_hurdle_rate_primary * 100) | round(2)}}% of its Principal Capital Contributions, then all distributions shall be made {{(carta.lp_carried_interest * 100) | round(2)}}% to the Member and {{(carta.gp_carried_interest * 100) | round(2)}}% to the Manager;
             (B) if the Member has received cumulative distributions of Disposition Proceeds (including for this purpose amounts deemed distributed to a Member pursuant to this Agreement) pursuant to this <u>Section 3.4(a)(ii)</u> that are equal to or more than {{(carta.premium_carry_hurdle_rate_primary * 100) | round(2)}}% of its Principal Capital Contributions{% if carta.premium_carry_hurdle_rate_secondary != null %}, but less than {{(carta.premium_carry_hurdle_rate_secondary * 100) | round(2)}}% of its Principal Capital Contributions,{% endif %} then all distributions shall be made one hundred percent (100%) to the Manager until the Manager has received cumulative distributions with respect to the Member equal to {{(carta.premium_carry_percentage_primary * 100) | round(2)}}% of the excess of (I) the sum of the aggregate distributions made to the Member pursuant to <u>Sections 3.4(a)</u> and <u>9.3(b)</u> and to the Manager with respect to the Member pursuant to this <u>Section 3.4(a)(ii)</u> over (II) the Principal Capital Contributions of the Member, and thereafter, all distributions shall be made {{(carta.premium_primary_carried_interest * 100) | round(2)}}% to the Member and {{(carta.premium_carry_percentage_primary * 100) | round(2)}}% to the Manager; {% if carta.premium_carry_hurdle_rate_secondary != null %}or
             (C) if the Member has received cumulative distributions of Disposition Proceeds (including for this purpose amounts deemed distributed to a Member pursuant to this <u>Section 3.4(a)(ii)</u> that are equal to or more than {{(carta.premium_carry_hurdle_rate_secondary * 100) | round(2)}}% of its Principal Capital Contributions, then all distributions shall be made one hundred percent (100%) to the Manager until the Manager has received cumulative distributions with respect to the Member equal to {{(carta.premium_carry_percentage_secondary * 100) | round(2)}}% of the excess of (I) the sum of the aggregate distributions made to the Member pursuant to <u>Sections 4.2(a)</u> and <u>9.3(b)</u> and to the Manager with respect to the Member pursuant to this <u>Section 3.4(a)(ii)</u>; over (II) the Principal Capital Contributions of the Member, and thereafter, all distributions shall be made {{(carta.premium_secondary_carried_interest * 100) | round(2)}}% to the Member and {{(carta.premium_carry_percentage_secondary * 100) | round(2)}}% to the Manager. {% else %} {% endif %} {% endif %}
     
		- <u>Waiver or Sharing of Carried Interest</u>. For the avoidance of doubt, the Manager, from time to time and in its sole discretion, may waive or reduce the Carried Interest to be distributed or otherwise paid to the Manager by or on behalf of any Members. The Manager may, in its sole discretion, share with one or more Persons all or any portion of any Carried Interest.
      - <u>Disposition Proceeds Available for Distribution</u>. Any unpaid Company Expenses or outstanding debts or obligations of the Company and any Company Expenses relating to the Disposition of a Portfolio Investment, including any brokerage commissions, escrow fees, clearing and settlement charges, and custodial fees shall be paid by the Company prior to any distribution pursuant to this Section 3.4. In addition, the amount of Disposition Proceeds that are distributable to the Members shall be net of the amount of cash which the Manager, in its sole discretion, deems necessary or appropriate to establish reserves for the payment of future or potential Company Expenses, liabilities or obligations.
      - <u>Temporary Investment Income</u>. Temporary Investment Income shall be distributed to the Members pro rata in proportion to Principal Capital Contributions, or used to pay for Company Expenses, as determined by the Manager in its sole discretion, and will not be distributed pursuant to <u>Section 3.4(a)</u>.
   1. **<u>Defaulting Member**</u>
        - Except as otherwise expressly provided under this Agreement, in the event that a Member fails to make any Capital Contribution payment required to be paid hereunder, and such failure continues for twenty (20) days after receipt of notice of such default, then such Member shall be in default (a “<u>Defaulting Member</u>”) and may, in addition to such other rights and remedies as may be available to it under applicable law, be subject to the provisions of this <u>Section 3.5</u>.
        - Except as provided in this <u>Section 3.5(b)</u>, a Defaulting Member shall not be entitled to make any further Principal Capital Contributions to the Company. The Manager shall impose a default charge on the Defaulting Member (as calculated pursuant to <u>Section 3.5(d)</u>) and will have the option to take one (1) or more of the following steps:
          - offer each non-Defaulting Member the opportunity to elect to increase its Interest by its *pro rata* share of the Principal Capital Contribution owed to the Company by the Defaulting Member, such *pro rata* share determined on the basis of such non-Defaulting Member’s Principal Capital Contribution(s) at the time of default compared to the total Principal Capital Contributions of all non-Defaulting Members that elect to increase their Interests at such time (if a non-Defaulting Member increases its Interest under this <u>Section 3.5(b)(i)</u>,then such non-Defaulting Member’s Percentage Interest shall be adjusted to reflect the increased Interest of such Member);
          - reduce the Defaulting Member’s Interest (including, without limitation, the Defaulting Member’s Percentage Interest and Capital Account) by fifty percent (50%) and reallocate such reduced Percentage Interest and Capital Account among all Members other than the Defaulting Member on terms established by the Manager in its discretion, <u>provided</u> that the amount so reallocated to any Member shall not reduce the Interest of such non-Defaulting Member;
          - cause a forfeiture of any portion of an Interest back to the Company which such Defaulting Member was issued but had not yet paid for at the time of the default and reduce such Defaulting Member’s Interest to the amount such Defaulting Member has contributed as of the date thereof. In addition, the Company will have the authority to sell the Interest attributable to the unfulfilled Interest to the other investors;
          - assist the Defaulting Member in selling its Interest in the Company;
          - accept a late Capital Contribution from the Defaulting Member (with interest calculated pursuant to <u>Section 3.5(d)</u>);
          - require that, whenever the vote, consent, or decision of a Member or of the Members is required or permitted pursuant to this Agreement, any Defaulting Member shall, to the extent determined by the Manager, not be entitled to participate in such vote or consent, or to make such decision, and, to such extent determined by the Manager, such vote, consent or decision shall be tabulated or made as if such Defaulting Member were not a Member; and
          - pursue and enforce all of the Company’s other rights and remedies against the Defaulting Member that may exist under this Agreement or applicable law.
       - For avoidance of doubt, no right, power or remedy conferred in this <u>Section 3.5</u> shall be exclusive, and each such right, power or remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to every other right, power or remedy whether conferred in this <u>Section 3.5</u>, or now or hereafter available at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise. No course of dealing among the Members and no delay in exercising any right, power or remedy conferred in this <u>Section 3.5</u>, or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise shall operate as a waiver or otherwise prejudice any such right, power or remedy.
       - The default charge imposed on a Defaulting Member pursuant to this <u>Section 3.5</u> shall equal the lesser of (i) the Default Rate or, (ii) the highest rate permitted by applicable law, on any past due amount from the date such amount became due until the date on which such payment is received by the Company (by application of withheld distributions or otherwise), or such lower amount, as determined by the Manager in its discretion. Any such default charge so paid by a Defaulting Member shall be distributed to the non-Defaulting Members. Amounts contributed by a Defaulting Member in respect of the default charge as required by this <u>Section 3.5</u> shall not be considered a Principal Capital Contribution for purposes of this Agreement.

1. <center>**[clause="manager"]THE MANAGER**</center>
  
   1. <u>**Investments**</u>. The Company will invest in Portfolio Investments and, at such time as any funds of the Company are not invested in Portfolio Investments or distributed to the Members, the Manager shall maintain such funds either in Temporary Investments or, to the extent the Manager determines in good faith it is not reasonably practical to do so, in cash.
   1. <u>** Powers of the Manager**</u>.
      - The management, operation and policy of the Company shall be vested exclusively in the Manager, which shall have the power by itself and shall be authorized and empowered on behalf and in the name of the Company to carry out any and all of the objects and purposes of the Company and to perform all acts and enter into and perform all contracts and other undertakings that it may in its sole discretion deem necessary or advisable or incidental thereto, all in accordance with and subject to the other terms of this Agreement. The Company, and the Manager on behalf of the Company, may enter into and perform any Subscription Documents and any documents contemplated thereby or related thereto and any amendments thereto, without any further act, vote or approval of any Person, including any Member, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement. The Manager is hereby authorized to enter into the documents described in the preceding sentence on behalf of the Company, but such authorization shall not be deemed a restriction on the power of the Manager to enter into other documents on behalf of the Company.
      - Without limiting the foregoing general powers and duties, the Manager is hereby authorized and empowered, acting on behalf and in the name of the Company, or on its own behalf and in its own name, or through agents, including its Affiliate(s), if any, as may be appropriate, subject to the limitations contained elsewhere in this Agreement, to:

         - direct the formulation of investment policies and strategies for the Company, and select and approve the investment of Company funds, all in accordance with the limitations of this Agreement;
         - acquire, hold, sell, transfer, exchange, pledge and dispose of Portfolio Investments, and exercise all rights, powers, privileges and other incidents of ownership or possession with respect to Portfolio Investments, including, without limitation, the voting of Portfolio Investments, the approval of a restructuring of investments in the Portfolio Company, participation in arrangements with creditors, the institution and settlement or compromise of suits and administrative proceedings and other similar matters;

         - make in good faith any and all elections for U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax matters, including any election to adjust the basis of Company property pursuant to Sections 734(b), 743(b) and 754 of the Code or comparable provisions of state, local or foreign law and any election under the Partnership Audit Provisions, and shall have any powers necessary to perform fully in such capacity;
         - act as (or designated another Person to act as) the "partnership representative" under the Code and in any similar capacity under state, local or foreign law; and
         - have the power to resolve, or consent to the resolution of, conflicts of interest on behalf of, and such resolution will be binding on, the Company. <br><br>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Manager, in its own name and on behalf of the Company, shall be authorized without the consent of any Person, including any other Member, to take such action as it determines in its sole discretion to be necessary or advisable to comply with any anti-money laundering or anti-terrorist laws, rules, regulations, directives or special measures, including the actions contemplated in the Subscription Documents.
      - The Manager has currently delegated to the Administrator the authority to, among other things, handle the fund administration services relating to the Company and the Members.

      - The Manager may delegate to its Affiliate, if any, the authority to, among other things, perform all of the Company’s investment-related activities and make all of the Company’s investment-related decisions.
   1. <u>**Limitation on Liability; Standard of Care**</u>.
      - None of the Manager, its Affiliates, if any, nor each of their respective direct or indirect officers, directors, stockholders, members, employees, partners (other than Members in their capacity as such), representatives, agents, including without limitation, the Administrator, and any other Person who serves at the request of the Manager on behalf of the Company as an officer, director, member, stockholder, partner, employee of the Company or any other entity (each of the foregoing, an "<u>Protected Person</u>") shall be liable to the Company or to any Member for (i) any act or omission taken or suffered or any act or omission allegedly taken or suffered, even if negligent by any Protected Person in connection with the conduct of the affairs of the Company, the Portfolio Company in connection with this Agreement or the matters contemplated herein, unless it is determined in each case by any court or governmental body of competent jurisdiction in a final judgment or admitted by such Protected Person in a settlement of any lawsuit (other than in the context of a temporary, preliminary or similar injunction) that such act or omission resulted from fraud, bad faith, willful misconduct, gross negligence, a material breach of this Agreement by such Protected Person, which breach shall not have been cured within thirty (30) days after such breach, and except that nothing herein shall constitute a waiver or limitation of any rights which a Member or the Company may have under applicable securities laws or other laws and which may not be waived or (ii) any mistake, negligence, dishonesty or bad faith of any broker, adviser or other agent of the Company selected by the Manager with reasonable care.
      - The Manager shall exercise its powers and duties hereunder by acting in good faith, in what was reasonably believed to be in the best interest of the Company and that was reasonably believed to be within the scope of the authority conferred upon the Manager by this Agreement. To the extent that, at law or in equity or otherwise, a Protected Person has duties (including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to the Company or to another Member, such Protected Person acting under this Agreement shall not be liable to the Company or to any such other Member for its good faith reliance on the provisions of this Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement, to the extent that they expand, eliminate or restrict the duties and liabilities of the Protected Persons otherwise existing at law or in equity or otherwise, are agreed by the Members to modify to that extent such other duties and liabilities of such Protected Persons. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Administrator owes no fiduciary duties of any kind whatsoever to the Company, or to any of the Members, including, but not limited to, the duties of due care and loyalty, whether those duties were established as of the date of this Agreement or any time hereafter, and whether established under common law, at equity or legislatively defined.
      - The Manager may consult with legal counsel and accountants selected by it and any act or omission suffered or taken by it on behalf of the Company or in furtherance of the interests of the Company in good faith in reasonable reliance upon and in accordance with the advice of such counsel or accountants shall be full justification for any such act or omission, and such Protected Persons shall be fully protected in so acting or omitting to act; <u>provided</u> that such counsel or accountants were selected with reasonable care.
   1. <u>**Indemnification**</u>.
      - To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each of the Protected Persons from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs and expenses (including amounts paid in satisfaction of judgments, in compromises and settlements, as fines and penalties and legal or other costs and reasonable expenses of investigating or defending against any claim or alleged claim) of any nature whatsoever, known or unknown, liquidated or unliquidated, whether or not in connection with proceedings by or in the right of the Company, that are incurred by any Protected Person and/ or to which such Protected Person may be subject by reason of its activities or omissions or alleged activities or omissions, even if negligent, on behalf of the Company or in furtherance of the interest of the Company or otherwise arising out of or in connection with the affairs of the Company or the Portfolio Company or the performance by such Protected Person of any of the Manager's responsibilities hereunder; provided that: (i) a Protected Person shall be entitled to indemnification hereunder only to the extent that such Protected Person's conduct did not constitute (as determined in each case by any court or governmental body of competent jurisdiction in a final judgment or admitted by such Protected Person in a settlement of any lawsuit (other than in the context of a temporary, preliminary or similar injunction)) fraud, bad faith, willful misconduct, gross negligence, a material breach of this Agreement, which breach shall not have been cured within thirty (30) days after such breach; (ii) nothing herein shall constitute a waiver or limitation of any rights which a Member or the Company may have under applicable securities laws or other laws and which may not be waived; and (iii) the Company's obligations hereunder shall not apply with respect to (w) economic losses or tax obligations incurred by any Protected Person as a result of such Protected Person's ownership of an interest in the Company or in the Portfolio Company, (x) expenses of the Company that a Protected Person has agreed to bear, (y) claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs and expenses arising solely out of disputes between or among the members, partners or shareholders of the Manager or (z) claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs and expenses arising solely out of any Protected Person's service to the Portfolio Company occurring after the Company has Disposed of such Portfolio Investment. The satisfaction of any indemnification and any saving harmless pursuant to this Section 4.4(a) shall be from and limited to Company assets and no Member shall have any personal liability on account thereof; provided that each Member will be obligated to return any amounts distributed to it in order to fund any deficiency in the Company's indemnity obligations hereunder to the extent provided in Section 5.2.
      - Expenses reasonably incurred by a Protected Person in defense or settlement of any claim that may be subject to a right of indemnification hereunder shall be advanced by the Company prior to the final disposition thereof upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Protected Person to repay such amount to the extent that it shall be determined ultimately that such Protected Person is not entitled to be indemnified. No advances shall be made by the Company under this <u>Section 4.4(b)</u> without the prior written approval of the Manager.
      - The right of any Protected Person to the indemnification provided herein shall be cumulative of, and in addition to, any and all rights to which such Protected Person may otherwise be entitled by contract or as a matter of law or equity and shall extend to such Protected Person's successors, assigns and legal representatives.
      - Any Protected Person shall first seek recovery under any other indemnity or any insurance policies by which such Protected Person is indemnified or covered, as the case may be, but only to the extent that the indemnitor with respect to such indemnity or the insurer with respect to such insurance policy provides (or acknowledges its obligation to provide) such indemnity or coverage, as the case may be, on a timely basis. To the extent that a Protected Person receives an indemnification payment from the Company under <u>Section 4.4</u> in respect of the conduct of such Protected Person and then recovers amounts in respect of such conduct under any insurance policies referred to in the preceding sentence, such Protected Person shall return such recovered amounts (net of expenses incurred in connection with such recovery) to the Company up to the amount of such indemnification previously paid by the Company. For any such Protected Person other than the Manager, such Protected Person shall obtain the written consent of the Manager prior to entering into any compromise or settlement which would result in an obligation of the Company to indemnify such Protected Person. If liabilities arise out of the conduct of the affairs of the Company and any other Person for which the Protected Person was then acting in a similar capacity, the amount of the indemnification provided by the Company shall be limited to the Company's proportionate share thereof as determined in good faith by the Manager.
      - Any Protected Person shall be deemed to be a creditor of the Company and shall be entitled to enforce the obligations of Members to return distributions pursuant to <u>Section 5.2</u> following the termination of the Company.
      - The Manager may in its sole discretion cause the Company to purchase, at the Company's expense, insurance to insure the Manager or any other Protected Person against liability for any breach or alleged breach of their responsibilities under this Agreement or otherwise in connection with the Company or the Manager.
      - To the extent any indemnitor described in the first sentence of <u>Section 4.4(d)</u> is the Portfolio Company, it is intended that the Portfolio Company shall be liable on a primary basis to the applicable Person entitled to indemnification from the Company hereunder. Thereafter, the Company shall be liable on a secondary basis therefor and then the Manager shall be liable on a tertiary basis therefor.
   1. **<u>Manager as a Member**</u>. The Manager may also hold Interests as a Member, including to the extent that it purchases or becomes a transferee of all or any part of the Interest of a Member. With respect to any Interests held as a Member, the Manager shall be treated as a Member in all respects (except as provided in the next sentence). Any Interest of a Member that is held by the Manager or its Affiliate(s), if any, shall (i) except as otherwise provided, be voted and/or abstained in the same manner and proportions as the aggregate Interests of the other Members are voted and/or abstained and (ii) subject to legal, tax and regulatory considerations, participate in Portfolio Investments on the same terms and conditions as the other Members (but shall not, if determined in the Manager's discretion, bear any Carried Interest).
   1. **<u>Transactions with Affiliates**</u>.
      - The Manager and its Affiliates, if any, may engage in transactions with the Company or the Portfolio Company only to the extent that the Manager determines in good faith that the terms of such transactions, taken as a whole, are fair and reasonable to the Company and on economic terms that the Manager determines in good faith are not materially less favorable to the Company or the Portfolio Company than would be obtained in a transaction with an unaffiliated party.
      - This Agreement shall not be construed in any manner to preclude the Manager from engaging in any business or other activity whatsoever.

   1. **<u>Management**</u>.
      - Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, no Member shall have the right or power to participate in the management or affairs of the Company, nor shall any Member have the power to sign for or bind the Company or deal with third parties on behalf of the Company. The exercise by any Member of any right conferred herein shall not be construed to constitute participation by such Member in the control of the business of the Company so as to make such Member a manager of the Company for purposes of the Act.
      - Any Member may, upon notice to the Manager, elect to hold all or any fraction of such Member's Interest as a non-voting Interest, in which case such Member shall not be entitled to participate in any consent of the Members with respect to the portion of its Interest which is held as a non-voting Interest (and such non-voting Interest shall not be counted in determining the giving or withholding of any such consent). Except as provided in Section 5.1, an Interest held as a non-voting Interest shall be identical in all regards to all other Interests held by Members. Any such election shall be irrevocable and shall bind the assignees of such Member's Interest.
   1. **<u>Liabilities of the Members**</u>.
      - Generally, except as provided by the Act or other applicable law and subject to the obligations to make Capital Contributions pursuant to Article III, to indemnify the Company and the Members as provided in <u>Section 10.6(a)</u>, to return distributions as provided in <u>Section 5.2(b)</u>, to pay any expenses relating to the Transfer of such Member's Interest as provided in <u>Section 8.2(a)</u> and to repay the Company in respect of any Tax Advances made to such Member as provided in <u>Section 10.6(a)</u>, no Member shall have any personal liability whatsoever in its capacity as a Member, whether to the Company, to any of the Members, or to the creditors of the Company, for the debts, liabilities, contracts, or other obligations of the Company or for any losses of the Company; provided that a Member shall be required to return any distribution that was made to such Member in error.
      - Except as required by the Act, or other applicable law, or as otherwise required by the terms of this Agreement, no Member shall be required to repay to the Company, any Member or any creditor of the Company all or any part of the distributions made to such Member pursuant to Article III hereof; provided that to the maximum extent permitted by law and subject to the limitations set forth in <u>Section 5.2(c)(ii)</u>, the Manager may require a Member (including any former Member) to return distributions made to such Member or former Member (or any of its predecessors in interest) for the purpose of meeting such Member's share (as provided in <u>Section 5.2(c)</u>) of the Company's indemnity obligations under <u>Section 4.4</u> in an amount up to, but in no event in excess of, the aggregate amount of distributions actually received by such Member from the Company. However, if, notwithstanding the terms of this Agreement, it is determined under applicable law that any Member has received a distribution which is required to be returned to or for the account of the Company or Company creditors, then the obligation under applicable law of any Member to return all or any part of a distribution made to such Member shall be the obligation of such Member and not of any other Member. Any amount returned by a Member pursuant to this Section 5.2(b) shall be treated as a contribution of capital to the Company.

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if distributions of Carried Interest in respect of any Member have been made to the Manager, such Member's share of such Clawback Amount shall be reduced, and the Manager's share of such Clawback Amount shall be increased, by an amount equal to such Carried Interest distributions.
         - The obligation of a Member to return distributions made to such Member for the purpose of meeting the Company's indemnity obligations under <u>Section 4.4</u> shall be subject to the following limitations: (A) no Member shall be required to return a distribution (including the Final Distribution) after the second anniversary of the date of such distribution; provided that if at the end of such period, there are any Proceedings then pending or any other liability (whether contingent or otherwise) or claim then outstanding, the Manager shall so notify the Members at such time (which notice shall include a brief description of each such Proceeding (and of the liabilities asserted in such Proceeding) or of such liabilities and claims) and the obligation of the Members to return any distribution for the purpose of meeting the Company's indemnity obligations under Section 4.4 shall survive with respect to each such Proceeding, liability and claim set forth in such notice (or any related Proceeding, liability or claim based upon the same or a similar claim) until the date that such Proceeding, liability or claim is ultimately resolved and satisfied.

      - The determination by the Manager in good faith that such earlier dissolution and termination is necessary or advisable because there has been a material adverse change in any applicable law or regulation affecting the Company, its Portfolio Investment(s) and/or the Portfolio Company, or to avoid any violation of, or registration under, applicable law or regulation;
      - The determination by the Manager at any time to dissolve the Company;
      - The effective date of dissolution pursuant to <u>Section 8.1(b)(i)</u>;
      - At any time that there are no Members of the Company, unless the business of the Company is continued in accordance with the Act; or
      - The entry of a decree of judicial dissolution under Section 18-802 of the Act.
   1. **<u>Winding-up**</u>. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Dissolution, the Company shall be wound up, liquidated and subsequently terminated. The Manager or, if there is no manager, or if the Manager has defaulted on its obligations to make Capital Contributions, a liquidator appointed by a Majority in Interest of the Members, shall proceed with the Dissolution Sale and the Final Distribution. In the Dissolution Sale, the Manager or such liquidator shall use its reasonable efforts to reduce to cash and cash equivalent items such assets of the Company as the Manager or such liquidator shall deem it advisable to sell in an orderly fashion, subject to obtaining Fair Value for such assets and any tax or other legal or contractual considerations.
   1. **<u>Final Distribution**</u>. After the Dissolution Sale, the proceeds thereof and the other assets of the Company, which, for the avoidance of doubt, may include marketable securities or restricted securities, shall be distributed in one or more installments in the following order of priority:
      - to pay all creditors of the Company (including the payment of the expenses of the winding-up, liquidation and dissolution of the Company), including Members who are creditors of the Company, to the extent otherwise permitted by law, either by the payment thereof or the making of reasonable provision therefor (including the establishment of reserves, in amounts established by the Manager or such liquidator);
      - The remaining proceeds, if any, plus any remaining assets of the Company and any remaining cash set aside for the Company Expenses, shall be applied and distributed to the Members by the end of such taxable year or, if later, within ninety (90) days after the date of such liquidation in the same manner as distributions under <u>Section 3.4</u>. For purposes of the application of this <u>Section 9.3</u> and determining Capital Accounts on liquidation, all unrealized gains, losses and accrued income and deductions of the Company shall be treated as realized and recognized immediately before the date of distribution. If a Member shall, upon the advice of counsel, determine that there is a reasonable likelihood that any distribution in kind of an asset would cause such Member to be in violation of any law, regulation or order, such Member and the Manager shall each use its commercially reasonable efforts to make alternative arrangements for the sale or transfer into an escrow account of any such distribution on mutually agreeable terms.
		The Members understand and agree that there will be {% if carta.has_audit == true %}a {% else %} no {% endif %} liquidation audit prepared in connection with the dissolution of the Company.

1. <center>**[clause="accounts"]CAPITAL ACCOUNTS AND ALLOCATIONS OF PROFITS AND LOSSES**</center>
   1. **<u>Capital Accounts**</u>.
      - A separate capital account (the "<u>Capital Account</u>") shall be established and maintained for each Member. The Capital Account of each Member shall be credited with (i) such Member's Capital Contributions to the Company and any other amount contributed by such Member to the capital of the Company (including pursuant to <u>Section 5.2(b)</u>), (ii) all Profits allocated to such Member pursuant to <u>Section 10.2</u> and any items of income or gain which are specially allocated pursuant to <u>Section 10.3</u> or any other provision of this Agreement, and (iii) Company liabilities, if any, assumed by such Member or secured, in whole or in part, by any Company assets that are distributed to such Member; and shall be debited with (1) all Losses allocated to such Member pursuant to <u>Section 10.2</u>, (2) any items of loss or deduction of the Company specially allocated to such Member pursuant to Section 10.3 or any other provision of this Agreement, (3) all cash and the Carrying Value of any property (net of liabilities assumed by such Member and the liabilities to which such property is subject) distributed or deemed distributed pursuant to this Agreement by the Company to such Member and (4) liabilities, if any, of such Member assumed by the Company. To the extent not provided for in the preceding sentence, the Capital Accounts of the Members shall be adjusted and maintained in accordance with the rules of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-1(b) and 1.704-2, as the same may be amended or revised; <u>provided</u> that such adjustment and maintenance does not have a material adverse effect on the economic interests of the Members. Any references in any Section of this Agreement to the Capital Account of a Member shall be deemed to refer to such Capital Account as the same may be credited or debited from time to time as set forth above. In the event of any transfer of any interest in the Company in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the transferee shall succeed to the Capital Account of the transferor to the extent it relates to the transferred interest.
      - No Member shall be required to pay to the Company or to any other Member the amount of any negative balance which may exist from time to time in such Member's Capital Account.
   1. **<u>Allocations of Profits and Losses**</u>. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Profits and Losses and, to the extent necessary, individual items of income, gain, loss or deduction of the Company shall be allocated among the Members in a manner such that the Capital Account of each Member, immediately after making such allocation, is, as nearly as possible, equal (proportionately) to (i) the hypothetical distributions that would be made to such Member pursuant to <u>Section 3.4</u> if the Company's assets were sold for cash equal to their Carrying Value, all Company liabilities were satisfied (limited with respect to each nonrecourse liability to the Carrying Value of the assets securing such liability), and the net assets of the Company were distributed in accordance with <u>Section 3.4</u> to the Members immediately after making such allocation, minus (ii) such Member's share of Company Minimum Gain and Member Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain, computed immediately prior to the hypothetical sale of assets, minus (iii) in the case of each Member, any obligation of such Member to make any capital contribution to the Company pursuant to <u>Section 5.2(b)</u>. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Manager may make such allocations as it deems reasonably necessary to give economic effect to the provisions of this Agreement, taking into account facts and circumstances as the Manager deems reasonably necessary for this purpose.<br> <br>For the avoidance of doubt, it is the intention of the Members that, to the extent permitted by law, allocations made to the Manager and/or its Affiliates in respect of their Capital Contributions, if any, are intended to (i) be treated as “capital interest allocations” exempt from the provisions of Section 1061 of the Code (as described in Treasury Regulations Section 1.1061-3(c)(3) or any similar provision); (ii) be “separate and apart,” within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1061-3(c)(3)(ii)(B), from any allocations made to the Manager in respect of its Carried Interest attributable to the other Members; and (iii) meet the identification requirements of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1061-3(c)(3)(ii)(B).
   1. **<u>Special Allocation Provisions**</u>. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Article X:
      - <u>Minimum Gain Chargeback</u>. Except as otherwise provided in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(f), notwithstanding any other provision of this Article X, if there is a net decrease in Company Minimum Gain during any taxable year (or other relevant period), each Member shall be specially allocated items of Company income and gain for such taxable year (or other relevant period) (and, if necessary, subsequent taxable year (or other relevant period)) in an amount equal to such Member's share of the net decrease in Company Minimum Gain, determined in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(g). Allocations pursuant to the previous sentence shall be made in proportion to the respective amounts required to be allocated to each Member in accordance with Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-2(f)(6) and 1.704-2(j)(2). This <u>Section 10.3(a)</u> is intended to comply with the minimum gain chargeback requirements in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(f) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.
      - <u>Member Minimum Gain Chargeback</u>. Except as otherwise provided in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(4), notwithstanding any other provision of this Article X, if there is a net decrease in Member Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain attributable to a Member Nonrecourse Debt during any taxable year (or other relevant period), each Member who has a share of the Member Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain attributable to such Member Nonrecourse Debt, determined in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(5), shall be specially allocated items of Company income and gain for such taxable year (or other relevant period) (and, if necessary, subsequent taxable year (or other relevant period)) in an amount equal to such Member's share of the net decrease in Member Nonrecourse Debt, determined in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(4). Allocations pursuant to the previous sentence shall be made in proportion to the respective amounts required to be allocated to each Member pursuant thereto. The items to be allocated shall be determined in accordance with Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-2(i)(4) and 1.704-2(j)(2). This <u>Section 10.3(b)</u> is intended to comply with the minimum gain chargeback requirement in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(4) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.
      - <u>Qualified Income Offset</u>. If any Member unexpectedly receives any adjustments, allocations or distributions described in Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5) or (6) resulting in, or increasing, an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit for such Member, items of Company income and gain shall be specially allocated to each such Member in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate, to the extent required by the Treasury Regulations, the Adjusted Capital Account Deficit of such Member as quickly as possible; provided, that an allocation pursuant to this <u>Section 10.3(c)</u> shall be made only if and to the extent that such Member would have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit after all other allocations provided for in this Article X have been tentatively made as if this <u>Section 10.3(c)</u> were not in this Agreement.
      - <u>Gross Income Allocation</u>. In addition, if any Member has an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit at the end of any taxable year (or other relevant period), each such Member shall be specially allocated items of Company income and gain in the amount of such excess as quickly as possible; provided; that an allocation pursuant to this <u>Section 10.3(d)</u> shall be made only if and to the extent that such Member would have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit in excess of such sum after all other allocations provided for in this Article VII have been tentatively made as if this <u>Section 10.3(d)</u> were not in this Agreement.
      - <u>Stop Loss</u>. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of <u>Section 10.2</u>, the Losses (or items of expense or deduction or loss) allocated pursuant to Section 10.2 shall not exceed the maximum amount that can be so allocated without causing any Member to have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit at the end of any taxable year (or other relevant period). In the event some but not all of the Members would have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit as a consequence of an allocation of Losses pursuant to <u>Section 10.2</u>, the limitation set forth in this <u>Section 10.3(e)</u> shall be applied on a Member by Member basis so as to allocate the maximum permissible Losses to each Member under Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d). All Losses (or items of expense or deduction or loss) in excess of the limitation set forth in this <u>Section 10.3(e)</u> shall be allocated to other Members in accordance with the positive balances in such Members' Adjusted Capital Accounts so as to allocate the maximum permissible Losses to each Member under Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d).
      - <u>Nonrecourse Deductions</u>. Nonrecourse Deductions for any taxable year (or other relevant period) shall be specially allocated in a manner permitted under Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(e) and selected by the Manager.
      - <u>Member Nonrecourse Deductions</u>. Any Member Nonrecourse Deductions for any taxable year (or other relevant period) shall be specially allocated to the Members in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i).
      - <u>Section 754 Adjustments</u>. Items of income, gain, loss, and deductions shall be specifically allocated to the Members to comply with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m).
      - <u>Payee Allocation</u>. In the event any payment to any Person that is treated by the Company as the payment of an expense is recharacterized by a taxing authority as a Company distribution to the payee as a partner, such payee shall be specially allocated an amount of Company gross income and gain as quickly as possible equal to the amount of the distribution.
      - <u>Regulatory Allocations</u>. The allocations set forth in <u>Sections 10.3(a)</u> through (i) (collectively, the "Regulatory Allocations") are intended to comply with certain requirements of the Treasury Regulations. It is the intent of the parties to this Agreement that, to the extent possible, all Regulatory Allocations will be offset in the current taxable year or future taxable years either with other Regulatory Allocations or with special allocations of other items of Company income, gain, loss or deduction pursuant to this <u>Section 10.3(j)</u>.
   1. **<u>Tax Allocations**</u>. For income tax purposes only, each item of income, gain, loss and deduction of the Company shall be allocated among the Members in the same manner as the corresponding items of Profits and Losses and specially allocated items are allocated for Capital Account purposes; <u>provided</u> that in the case of any Company asset the Carrying Value of which differs from its adjusted tax basis for U.S. federal income tax purposes, income, gain, loss and deduction with respect to such asset shall be allocated solely for income tax purposes in accordance with the principles of Sections 704(b) and (c) of the Code (in any manner determined by the Manager) so as to take account of the difference between Carrying Value and adjusted basis of such asset. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Manager in its sole discretion shall make allocations for tax purposes as may be needed to ensure that allocations are in accordance with the interests of the Members within the meaning of the Code and the Regulations. The Manager shall determine all matters concerning allocations for tax purposes not expressly provided for herein in its sole discretion.
   1. **<u>Other Allocation Provisions**</u>. The foregoing provisions and the other provisions of this Agreement relating to the maintenance of Capital Accounts are intended to comply with Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-l(b) and shall be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with such regulations. <u>Section 10.2</u> to <u>Section 10.5</u> may be amended at any time by the Manager if necessary, in the opinion of tax counsel to the Company, to comply with such regulations, so long as any such amendment does not materially change the relative economic interests of the Members.
   1. **<u>Tax Advances**</u>.
      - To the extent the Manager reasonably determines that the Company is required by law to withhold or to make tax or any other payments on behalf of or with respect to any Member (or direct or indirect shareholder, member, or other owner of such Member), including withholding taxes, and state unincorporated business taxes, and payments pursuant to the Partnership Audit Provisions ("<u>Tax Advances</u>"), the Manager may withhold such amounts and make such tax payments as so required. All Tax Advances made on behalf of a Member shall, in the sole discretion of the Manager, (i) be promptly paid to the Company by the Member on whose behalf such Tax Advances were made or (ii) be repaid by reducing the amount of the current or next succeeding distribution or distributions which would otherwise have been made to such Member or, if such distributions are not sufficient for that purpose, by so reducing the proceeds of liquidation otherwise payable to such Member. Whenever the Manager selects option (ii) pursuant to the preceding sentence for repayment of a Tax Advance by a Member, for all other purposes of this Agreement such Member shall be treated as having received all distributions (whether before or upon liquidation) unreduced by the amount of such Tax Advance. To the fullest extent permitted by law, each Member hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the other Members from and against any liability (including, without limitation, any liability for taxes, penalties, additions to tax or interest) with respect to income attributable to or distributions or other payments to such Member. A Member's obligation to pay or indemnify for a tax or payment (and related interest and penalties) shall survive the Member selling or otherwise disposing of its interest in the Company and the termination, dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the Company.
      - Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Manager may receive a cash advance against distributions of Carried Interest to the extent that distributions of Carried Interest actually received by the Manager during a fiscal period are not sufficient for the Manager or any of its partners or beneficial owners (whether their interests in the Manager are held directly or indirectly) to pay when due any income tax (including estimated income tax) imposed on it or them during such fiscal period (or any prior fiscal period), as applicable, with respect to allocations or distributions relating to Carried Interest, calculated using the Combined Tax Rate and taking into account any carryover of Company capital losses for prior period to the extent such losses would be deductible in determining the Manager's tax liability for such period, determined taking into account only the Manager's items of income, gain, loss and deduction attributable to the Company. Amounts advanced pursuant to this <u>Section 10.6(b)</u> shall be treated as repaid from subsequent distributions under <u>Section 3.4</u>.
      - If requested by the Manager, each Member shall, if able to do so, deliver to the Manager: (x) an affidavit in form satisfactory to the Manager that the applicable Member (or its direct or indirect owners, as the case may be) is not subject to withholding under the provisions of any federal, state, local, foreign or other law; (y) any certificate or other document that the Manager may reasonably request with respect to any such laws, including any form, certification, or other information required by Section 1471-1474 of the Code (and the Regulations or other authority promulgated thereunder); and/or (z) any other form or instrument reasonably requested by the Manager relating to any Member's status under such laws. If a Member fails or is unable to deliver to the Manager an affidavit described in subclause (x) or certificate or other documentation described in subclause (y) or (z) of this <u>Section 10.6(c)</u>, the Manager may withhold amounts from such Member in accordance with <u>Section 10.6(a)</u>, and such Member acknowledges that it may be subject to the provisions of <u>Section 3.3(e)</u>. 
		<center>**ARTICLE XI**</center><br>
1. <center>**[clause="miscellaneous"]MISCELLANEOUS**</center>
   1. **<u>Waiver of Partition and Accounting**</u>. Except as may be otherwise required by law, each Member hereby irrevocably waives any and all rights that it may have to maintain an action for an accounting or for partition or any similar action of any of the Company's property.
   1. **<u>Confidentiality**</u>.
      - Each Member will maintain the confidentiality and not disclose information which is nonpublic information furnished by the Manager regarding the Manager and/or the Company (including information regarding any Portfolio Investment that the Company holds or contemplates acquiring) received by such Member (including, without limitation, in connection with any meeting of the Members), except (i) as otherwise required by governmental regulatory agencies (including tax authorities in connection with an audit or other similar examination of such Member), law or legal process (<u>provided</u> that any disclosure that is either (A) not to such a governmental regulatory agency or (B) not on a confidential basis, shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, require prior written notice thereof to the Manager) or (ii) to directors, employees, representatives and advisors of such Member and its Affiliate(s), if any, who need to know the information and who are informed of the confidential nature of the information and agree to keep it confidential. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Member acknowledges that notices and reports to Members (including, without limitation, any information provided in connection with any meeting of the Members) may contain material nonpublic information concerning, among other things, the Portfolio Company and agrees not to use such information other than in connection with monitoring its investment in the Company and agrees in that regard not to trade in securities on the basis of any such information. 
      - Notwithstanding the provisions of <u>Section 11.2(a)</u> above, the Manager agrees that each Member that (i) itself is an investment partnership or other collective investment vehicle having reporting obligations to its limited partners or other investors and (ii) has prior to the closing of its subscription for Interests notified the Manager in writing that it is electing the benefits of this <u>Section 11.2(b)</u> may, in order to satisfy each of their respective reporting obligations, provide on a confidential basis the following information to such Persons regarding the Company and the Portfolio Company: (A) the cost of the Company's investment in the Portfolio Company and the percentage interest of the Portfolio Company acquired by the Company (but not the current value of such investment in the Portfolio Company), (B) a description of the business of the Portfolio Company and information regarding the industry and geographic location of the Portfolio Company, (C) the book value of the Portfolio Company on the last day of the quarter, (D) a brief description of the investment strategy of the Company, and (E) the name and address of the Company.

      - Notwithstanding the obligation of confidentiality set out in this <u>Section 11.2</u>, to comply with Treasury Regulations Section 1.601l-4(b)(3)(i), each Member (and any employee, representative, or other agent of such Member) may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the U.S. federal income tax treatment and tax structure of the Company or any transactions contemplated by the Company under this Agreement. However, any such information relating to the tax treatment or tax structure is required to be kept confidential to the extent necessary to comply with any applicable federal or state securities laws. For purposes of the two preceding sentences, tax treatment and tax structure shall not include, and such Member (or employee, representative or agent thereof) shall not disclose (i) the name of, or any other identifying information regarding, the Company or any existing or future investor (or any Affiliate thereof) in the Company, or any investment or transaction entered into by the Company and any information regarding the specific economic terms of the Company (including, without limitation, the amount of any fees and the percentages used in calculating Carried Interest), (ii) any performance information relating to the Company or its investments, or (iii) any performance or other information relating to other funds or investments sponsored or managed by the Manager or its Affiliate(s), if any.
      - In order to preserve the confidentiality of certain information disseminated by the Manager or the Company under this Agreement that a Member is entitled to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement (or in situations where the Manager determines in good faith that a Member has violated or is reasonably likely to violate the confidentiality provisions of this Agreement), including, but not limited to, quarterly, annual and other reports (other than the IRS Form 1065 and Schedule K-l, and information provided at the Company's informational meetings, the Manager or its Affiliate(s), if any, may (i) provide to such Member access to such information only on a website maintained by the Manager or its Affiliate(s), if any, in password protected, non-downloadable, non-printable format, and/or (ii) require such Member to return any copies of information provided to it by the Manager or the Company, subject to <u>Section 11.2(c)</u>.
      - To the extent that the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552, ("<u>FOIA</u>"), any state public records access law, any state or other jurisdiction's laws similar in intent or effect to FOIA, or any other similar statutory or regulatory requirement would potentially cause a Member or its Affiliate(s), if any, to disclose information relating to the Company, the Manager or its Affiliate(s), if any, and/or the Portfolio Company such Member hereby agrees that, in addition to compliance with the notice requirements set forth in <u>Section 11.2(a)</u> above, such Member (x) shall take commercially reasonable steps to oppose and prevent the requested disclosure unless (i) the Manager does not object in writing to such disclosure within ten (10) Business Days (or such lesser time period as stipulated by the applicable law) of such notice or (ii) such disclosure solely relates to fund-level, aggregate performance information (i.e., aggregate cash flows, overall "IRRs," the year of formation of the Company, and such Member's own Capital Contribution) and does not include (A) any information relating to the Portfolio Company, (B) copies of this Agreement and related documents or (C) any other information not referred to in this clause (ii), and (y) acknowledges and agrees that notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Manager may, in order to prevent any such potential disclosure that the Manager determines in good faith is likely to occur, withhold all or any part of the information otherwise to be provided to such Member other than the fund-level, aggregate performance information specified in this clause (ii) and the IRS Form 1065 and Schedule K-l.
      - Any obligation of a Member pursuant to this <u>Section 11.2</u> may be waived by the Manager in its sole discretion.
      - A Member may by giving written notice to the Manager elect not to receive copies of any document, report or other information that such Member would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this Agreement and is not required by applicable law to be delivered. The Manager agrees that it shall make any such documents available to such Member at the Manager's offices (or, at the request of such Member, the offices of counsel to the Company) on terms and conditions set forth in <u>Section 7.1</u>. 
   1. **<u>Power of Attorney**</u>. Each Member hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the Manager, with full power of substitution, the true and lawful attorney-in-fact and agent of such Member, to execute, acknowledge, verify, swear to, deliver, record and file, in its or its assignee's name, place and stead, all in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, all instruments, documents and certificates which may from time to time be required by the laws of the United States of America, the State of Delaware, any other jurisdiction in which the Company conducts or plans to conduct its affairs, or any political subdivision or agency thereof to effectuate, implement and continue the valid existence and affairs of the Company, including, without limitation, the power and authority to execute, verify, swear to, acknowledge, deliver, record and file:

      - This Agreement may be amended or supplemented by the written consent of the Manager and either, at the Manager's option, (x) a Majority in Interest of the Members consent thereto or (y) a Majority in Interest of the Members do not object to such amendment within twenty (20) days of being provided with notice thereof; <u>provided</u> that no such amendment shall (i) reduce any Member's share of the Company's distributions, income and gains, increase its share of the Company's losses payable by such Member hereunder, without the written consent of each such Member so affected, (ii) change the percentage of interests of Members (the "<u>Required Interest</u>") necessary for any consent required hereunder to the taking of an action unless such amendment is approved by Members who then hold interests equal to or in excess of the Required Interest for the subject of such proposed amendment, (iii) amend this <u>Section 11.4</u> without the consent of each Member adversely affected by such amendment, or (iv) make any amendment that by its terms would have a disproportionate material and adverse effect on a Member without the consent of such Member adversely affected by such amendment.

Each provision of this Agreement shall be considered severable and if for any reason any provision which is not essential to the effectuation of the basic purposes of this Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable and contrary to the Act or existing or future applicable law, such invalidity shall not impair the operation of or affect those provisions of this Agreement which are valid. In that case, this Agreement shall be construed so as to limit any term or provision so as to make it enforceable or valid within the requirements of any applicable law, and in the event such term or provision cannot be so limited, this Agreement shall be construed to omit such invalid or unenforceable provisions.

   1. **<u>Governing Law and Jurisdiction**</u>.
      - Notwithstanding the place where this Agreement may be executed by any of the parties thereto, the parties expressly agree that all the terms and provisions hereof shall be construed under the laws of the State of Delaware and, without limitation thereof, that the Act as now adopted or as may be hereafter amended shall govern this Agreement.
      - Any legal disagreement, dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the interpretation hereof, the relationship contemplated hereby, or the breach, termination or invalidity hereof shall be finally resolved by arbitration in {{carta.gp_entity_city}}, {{carta.gp_entity_state}} conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Arbitration under this <u>Section 11.8</u> shall be initiated by written demand for arbitration specifying the controversy or claim on which arbitration is sought, as well as the relief requested. Arbitration shall be before a panel of one arbitrator, who shall be selected by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the extent practical within fifteen (15) Business Days following receipt by the respondent of the demand to arbitrate.

The parties agree to use all commercially reasonable efforts to assure that the arbitration procedure set forth herein, once commenced, shall be completed as expeditiously as possible. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the parties and judgment upon the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. This arbitration agreement is intended to be self-executing. The expenses of arbitration shall be borne by the party against whom the decision is rendered, or apportioned in accordance with the decision of the arbitrators in the event of a compromise decision. All notices from one party to the other relating to any arbitration hereunder shall be in writing and shall be effective if given in accordance with the provisions of <u>Section 11.7</u>. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the arbitration provisions set forth herein, and any arbitration conducted thereunder, shall be governed exclusively by the Federal Arbitration Act, Title 9, United States Code and by the 1958 United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, to the exclusion of any state or municipal law of arbitration. 
      - Notwithstanding anything contained in <u>Section 11.8(b)</u>, any party shall have the right to institute judicial proceedings against another party or any Person acting by, through or under such party in order to enforce the instituting party's rights hereunder through specific performance, injunction or similar equitable relief. Each party hereby submits to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware located in New Castle County for purposes thereof. Each party hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such courts and any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such courts has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each party hereby consents to process being served in any such suit, action or proceeding by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to its address designated in accordance with <u>Section 11.7</u>. Each party hereby agrees that such service (x) shall be deemed in every respect effective service of process upon it in any such suit, action or proceeding and (y) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be taken and held to be valid personal service upon and personal delivery to it.
   1. **<u>Successors and Assigns**</u>. Except with respect to the rights of Protected Persons hereunder, none of the provisions of this Agreement shall be for the benefit of or enforceable by Persons not party to this Agreement (including the creditors of the Company or the Manager) and this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Members and their legal representatives, heirs, successors and permitted assigns.
   1. **<u>Counterparts**</u>. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument.
   1. **<u>Interpretation**</u>. Wherever from the context it appears appropriate, each term stated in either the singular or the plural shall include the singular and the plural, and pronouns stated in either the masculine or the neuter gender shall include the masculine, the feminine and the neuter. The words "include," "includes" and "including" shall be deemed to be followed by the phrase "without limitation" to the extent such words are not already so qualified. This Agreement shall not be construed against any party by reason of that party having caused this Agreement to be drafted. To the fullest extent permitted by law and notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or in any agreement contemplated herein or applicable provisions or law or equity or otherwise, whenever in this Agreement a Person is permitted or required to make a decision in its "good faith" or under another express standard, such Person shall act under such express standard and shall not be subject to any other or different standards.
   1. **<u>Headings; Internal References**</u>. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, Annexes, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section, Annex, Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, index of defined terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience and reference purposes only and shall not be deemed to alter or affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of any provisions of this Agreement. The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
   1. **<u>Partnership Status**</u>. The Company shall be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and no election to the contrary shall be made.
   1. **<u>Counsel to the Company**</u>. Counsel to the Company may also be counsel to the Manager. The Manager may execute on behalf of the Company and the Members any consent to the representation of the Company that counsel may request pursuant to the applicable rules of professional conduct in any jurisdiction ("<u>Rules</u>"). The Company may, at the Manager's sole discretion, select legal counsel (the "<u>Company Counsel</u>") to the Company. Each Member acknowledges that the Company Counsel does not represent any Member in the absence of a clear and explicit agreement to such effect between the Member and the Company Counsel (and then only to the extent specifically set forth in that agreement), and that in the absence of any such agreement the Company Counsel shall owe no duties directly to a Member. In the event any dispute or controversy arises between any Member and the Company, or between any Member or the Company, on the one hand, and the Manager that the Company Counsel represents, on the other hand, then each Member agrees that the Company Counsel may represent either the Company, the Manager, or each of them, in any such dispute or controversy to the extent permitted by the Rules, and each Member hereby consents to such representation. Each Member further acknowledges that the Company Counsel has not represented the interest of any Member in the preparation and negotiation of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all or any portion of the foregoing shall not apply to a Member to the extent that the foregoing is inconsistent with an established policy of a Member that is an institutional investor, and such Member notifies the Manager of such policy in writing prior to such Member's admission to the Company.
   1. **<u>Force Majeure**</u>. Whenever any act or thing is required of the Company, the Manager or its Affiliate(s), if any, or the Administrator hereunder to be done within any specified period of time, the Company, the Manager or its Affiliate(s), if any, or the Administrator, as the case may be, shall be entitled to such additional period of time to do such act or thing as shall equal any period of delay resulting from causes beyond the reasonable control of the Company, the Manager or its Affiliate(s), if any, or the Administrator, as the case may be; provided that this provision shall not have the effect of permanently relieving the Company, the Manager or its Affiliate(s), if any, or the Administrator from the obligation to perform any such act or thing.
   1. **<u>Waiver**</u>. No waiver of the provisions hereof shall be valid unless in writing and signed by the party to be bound and then only to the extent therein set forth. Except as specifically herein provided, no failure or delay by any party in exercising any right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, and a waiver of a particular right or remedy on one occasion shall not be deemed a waiver of any other right or remedy or a waiver on any subsequent occasion.
