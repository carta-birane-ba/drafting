Proceeds available for distribution, (the **“Distributable Proceeds”**), other than from short-term holdings, will be preliminarily apportioned among the Partners pro rata according to their respective aggregate Capital Contributions. The amount apportioned to the GP Affiliated Person(s) (in connection with their Capital Contribution(s)) will be distributed to the GP Affiliated Person(s).  The Distributable Proceeds preliminarily apportioned to each Limited Partner (other than any GP Affiliated Person(s)) will be further divided between such Limited Partner and the General Partner and distributed in the following priority and manner: 

      - first, 100% to such Limited Partner until such Limited Partner has received distributions pursuant to this clause (i) equal to its Capital Contributions; and

      - thereafter, 80% to the Limited Partner and 20% to the General Partner (the amounts payable to the General Partner under this clause (ii), the **“Carried Interest”** distributions) [***VBN note: we can make this waterfall variable, populated by corresponding questions in the questionnaire.***]

 The General Partner may receive cash distributions from the Fund to enable it and its members to pay any tax liabilities (including estimated tax liabilities) arising from the General Partner’s receipt of Carried Interest.  For purposes of determining the amount of such distribution, the General Partner may assume that the highest combined federal and state income tax rates of a member of the General Partner applies (the **“Combined Tax Rate”**). Any such distributions shall be treated as an advance of, and shall reduce, future distributions of Carried Interest to the General Partner.
[ls]
**Reinvestment:**
[c]
 Upon the receipt of proceeds from a Portfolio Investment during the Investment Period, the General Partner, in consultation with the Management Company, may either (i) reinvest (or reserve for reinvestment) or use (or reserve for later use) all or part of the Disposition Proceeds, or (ii) distribute the Disposition Proceeds to the Partners that increase each Partner’s unfunded Capital Commitment by an amount equal to the amounts distributed to it (and such amounts will be subject to recall by the Fund for any purpose that Capital Contributions may be called).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the aggregate cost basis of all Portfolio Investments made by the Fund will not exceed 120% of aggregate Capital Commitments.
[ls]
**General Partner Clawback:**
[c]
 As promptly as practicable (but not more than ninety (90) days) after the Fund’s final liquidating distribution, the General Partner will determine whether there was an Over Distribution. An “Over Distribution” means the positive amount determined by subtracting (i) the cumulative distributions that would have been received by the General Partner as Carried Interest determined as if the Fund retained all of the Fund’s distributions to the Partners since inception and made a single distribution to the Partners on the date of the Fund’s final liquidating distribution, from (ii) the cumulative distributions that the General Partner actually received as Carried Interest over the Fund’s term. In the event there is an Over Distribution, the General Partner shall contribute to the Fund for distribution to all Limited Partners (other than Defaulting Partners, as defined below) pro rata the amount of the Over Distribution; provided, that in no event shall the General Partner be required to return an amount greater than the Carried Interest distributions actually received by the General Partner, net of taxes thereon.
[ls]
**Return of Distributions:**
[c]
 If the Fund incurs any liability or obligation, including pursuant to a recycling obligation or limited partner clawback obligation of the Fund to an Underlying Fund to return distributions it has received from such Underlying Fund, and the amount of reserves and the unfunded Capital Commitments are less than the amount of such liability or obligation, the General Partner may require the Partners to return distributions to the Fund in an amount sufficient to satisfy all or any portion of such liability or obligation; provided, that (i) no distribution may be recalled following the third anniversary of the Fund’s dissolution (except in respect of pending liabilities or obligations) and (ii) the total amount recalled from any Partner shall not exceed the lesser of (A) 25% of such Partner’s Capital Commitment and (B) the aggregate amount of distributions made to such Partner from the Fund.
[ls]
**Key Persons:**
[c]
 If, prior to the sooner to occur of the end of the Investment Period or the date of the initial closing of a Successor Fund (as defined below), {% if container.principalsNumber == '1' %} The principal {% elif container.principalsNumber == '2' %} one (1) of the two (2) Principals {% elif container.principalsNumber == '3' %} two (2) of the three (3) Principals {% elif container.principalsNumber == '4' %} three (3) of the four (4) Princiapls. {% else %} (i) transfer(s) more than fifty percent (50%) of his or her interest in the General Partner to a third party or (ii) die(s) or (iii) cease(s) to be actively involved in the day-to-day management of the Fund for a period of 180 consecutive days, a **“Key Person Event”** shall be deemed to occur.{% endif %}
In the event that a Key Person Event is deemed to occur, the General Partner will give prompt written notice thereof to the Limited Partners and the Investment Period shall be suspended (**“Suspension”**).  Upon a Suspension, the Fund may not make any new investments without the approval of the Advisory Committee or a majority in interest of the Limited Partners, other than (i) Follow-On Investments that are approved by the Advisory Committee (as defined below) or a majority in interest of the Limited Partners, or (ii) Follow-Up Investments existing prior to the Key Person Event. 
Upon the commencement of a Suspension, the Advisory Committee or a majority in interest of the Limited Partners will have 180 days from the date of the Key Person Event to approve a remediation plan for such Key Person Event (thereby lifting the Suspension and allowing the Fund to recommence normal investment activities). If the Advisory Committee or a majority in interest of the Limited Partners does not approve a remediation plan for such Key Person Event within 180 days of the date of the Key Person Event, then the Investment Period shall automatically and immediately be terminated, unless, within such 180-day period, the Advisory Committee or a majority in interest of the Limited Partners vote to lift the Suspension and allow the Fund to recommence normal investment activities.
[ls]
**Parallel Fund:**
[c]
 To accommodate the legal, regulatory, tax and/or other considerations of certain Limited Partners, the General Partner may form one or more investment vehicles that will invest alongside the Fund and have substantially the same terms as the Fund (each, a **“Parallel Fund”**).  The Fund and each Parallel Fund will generally co-invest in each Portfolio Investment proportionately and make and dispose of each Portfolio Investment on substantially the same terms.
[ls]
**Alternative Investment Vehicles:**
[c]
 In connection with any investment, the General Partner may form and direct that the Capital Contributions of some or all of the Partners be effected through one or more alternative investment vehicles if, in the sole discretion of the General Partner, the use of such vehicles would allow the Fund to overcome legal or regulatory constraints, be more tax-efficient and/or facilitate participation in certain types of investments. Except as otherwise set forth in the Partnership Agreement, any such vehicles will contain terms and conditions generally comparable to those of the Fund and will be managed by the General Partner, the Management Company or an affiliate thereof.
[ls]
**Co-Investment:**
[c]

 The General Partner may, in its sole discretion, provide or commit to provide co-investment opportunities to one or more Limited Partners and/or other persons, in each case on terms to be determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion. In exercising its discretion to allocate co-investment opportunities with respect to a particular Portfolio Investment to and among potential co-investors and the terms thereof, the General Partner, in consultation with the Management Company, may consider some or all of a wide range of factors.
[ls]
**Successor Funds:**
[c]
 None of the General Partner, the Management Company or the Principal(s) will accept subscriptions for interests in a new fund (other than any Parallel Funds, Alternative Investment Vehicles, co-investment vehicles or special purpose vehicles) with investment objectives and strategies substantially similar to those of the Fund (a **“Successor Fund”**) until the earlier of (i) the date when at least 75% of the total Capital Commitments have been invested, expended, committed, allocated to or reserved for Portfolio Investments (including any Follow-On Investments and/or Follow-Up Investments) and/or for reasonably anticipated Fund Expenses and obligations or liabilities of the Fund, (ii) the end of the Investment Period or (iii) the winding up and dissolution of the Fund.
[ls]
**Default Provisions:**
[c]
 If any Limited Partner fails to pay its required Capital Contribution with respect to any portion of its undrawn Capital Commitment or other obligation to the Fund when called by the General Partner, the General Partner will have the right, but not the obligation, to treat such Limited Partner as a “Defaulting Partner.” As specified in the Partnership Agreement, a Defaulting Partner may be subject to significant penalties, including forfeiture of its interest in the Fund.  Non-defaulting Limited Partners may be required to make additional contributions of capital if a Limited Partner defaults, but not in excess of their unfunded Capital Commitments.
[ls] 
**Transferability of Interests:**
[c]
 A Limited Partner’s Interest may not be sold, assigned, transferred or pledged, except under certain limited circumstances and then only with the prior written consent of the General Partner.

[c]
 The Fund may establish an advisory committee made up of at least three and not more than five representatives of the Limited Partners approved by the General Partner (the **“Advisory Committee”**), provided that such Limited Partners are not GP Affiliated Persons.  If formed, the Advisory Committee will (i) approve certain actions described in the Partnership Agreement and (ii) provide advice and counsel in connection with any conflicts of interests or potential conflicts of interest that the General Partner reasonably determines are material with respect to the Fund.  Advisory Committee decisions will be authorized by a majority of the Advisory Committee members.

[c]
 The Fund will indemnify the GP Affiliated Persons and members of the Advisory Committee (including any Limited Partner represented by a member of the Advisory Committee) and all persons who previously served in such capacities (each, an **“Indemnified Person”**) against all liabilities incurred in connection with such Indemnified Person’s acts or omissions or alleged acts or omissions arising out of their activities on behalf of the Fund, provided that such Indemnified Person acted in a manner reasonably believed by such Indemnified Person to be in the best interest of the Fund and so long as such acts or omissions did not constitute (i) bad faith, fraud, gross negligence (as defined under the laws of the State of Delaware) or willful misconduct or (ii) an intentional and material (A) breach of the Partnership Agreement or (B) violation of applicable law; provided, further, that in the case of an Indemnified Person who is a member of the Advisory Committee (including any Limited Partner represented by a member of the Advisory Committee), such conduct was not taken by such Indemnified Person in bad faith.  
[ls] 
**Side Letters:**
[c]
 The General Partner, without any further act, approval or vote of any Limited Partner, may enter into side letters or other similar agreements with one or more Limited Partners that have the effect of altering or supplementing the terms of the Partnership Agreement (including, without limitation, economic terms) with respect to such Limited Partners. 
[ls] 
**Term:**

 The Fund will be wound up and dissolved 10 years after the Initial Closing (the **“Term”**), subject to extension by the General Partner for up to two additional one-year periods.

Reports and information will be subject to confidentiality restrictions and limitations as set forth in the Partnership Agreement. Each Limited Partner will be required to maintain information provided to it about the Fund or its business in the strictest confidence and to not disclose the information except in certain limited circumstances. 
[ls] 
**Tax Aspects:**
[c]
 The Fund intends to operate as a partnership and, accordingly, should not be subject to federal income tax.  Each Limited Partner will be required to report on its own annual tax return such Limited Partner’s distributive share of the Fund’s taxable income or loss.

Except as otherwise provided in the Partnership Agreement, the General Partner will use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) avoid having the Fund treated as income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States (**“ECI”**) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the **“Code”**), and (ii) conduct the affairs of the Fund to ensure that no tax exempt Limited Partner (or any of its equity owners) will be allocated unrelated business taxable income (**“UBTI”**) within the meaning of Section 512 of the Code; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to (i) any UBTI attributable to indebtedness and guarantees, (ii) any UBTI or ECI attributable to any Offset Fees, or (iii) any UBTI or ECI attributable to direct or indirect (e.g., through an entity established to facilitate the investment into digital assets) investment by the Fund in digital assets, if any.
