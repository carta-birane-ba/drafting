   1. <u> Capital Contributions.</u> 

      - The Partners shall make Capital Contributions to the Partnership in immediately available funds upon at least 10 Business Days’ notice; <u>provided</u>, that the General Partner may, and intends to, make an initial call of Capital Contributions on less than 10 Business Days’ notice at the Initial Closing. The General Partner will call Capital Contributions in accordance with and generally in proportion to the Partners respective Unfunded Commitments, subject to any adjustments pursuant to <u>Section 3.1</u>, at such times and in such amounts as determined by the General Partner in its discretion for Partnership Expenses and any other matter determined appropriate by the General Partner, including pursuant to <u>Section 3.7</u>; <u>provided</u> that if the General Partner calls Capital Contributions for the Management Fee, the General Partner will call Capital Contributions based on the Management Fee allocable to each such Limited Partner; <u>provided</u>, <u>further</u>, that each Limited Partner whose Commitment is less than or equal to the Minimum Commitment may, at the General Partner’s sole discretion, be required to contribute 100% of such Limited Partner’s Commitment upon such Limited Partner being admitted to the Partnership, and such Capital Contribution shall be deemed to satisfy future capital calls from the General Partner pursuant to <u>Section 3.2(c)</u>.

      - Each Capital Contribution made by a Partner to the Partnership shall be made in cash; <u>provided</u> that in the discretion of the General Partner, a Partner may make Capital Contributions in kind, including the Warehoused Investments described in <u>Section 5.9(e)</u>, if applicable; provided, further, that one or more of the GP Affiliated Person(s) that receive a portion of the Management Fee, if any, with the consent of the General Partner, may elect to waive some or all of such GP Affiliated Person(s)’ portion of the Management Fee for purposes of making cashless contributions, whereupon the amount that such GP Affiliated Person(s) would otherwise be obligated to contribute with respect to their respective Commitments made pursuant to <u>Section 3.1(a)</u> shall be reduced by up to 80% (the <u>“Cashless Portion”</u>), and each such reduction shall result in a corresponding Fee Adjustment, as defined in, and pursuant to, <u>Section 8.1(e)</u> to such GP Affiliated Person(s)’ portion of the Management Fee, respectively. The GP Affiliated Person(s) that intend to make their Capital Contributions pursuant to a Fee Adjustment hereby elect (irrevocably as to the current calendar year) to reduce 80% of each amount they would otherwise be obligated to contribute under <u>Section 3.1(a)</u>, respectively. The GP Affiliated Person(s) that make their Capital Contributions pursuant to a Fee Adjustment may adjust the Cashless Portion by written notice to the Limited Partners prior to the first day of any fiscal year, and such adjusted Cashless Portion shall apply for all subsequent periods unless adjusted further in accordance with this sentence. If any GP Affiliated Person(s) make an election to make their Capital Contributions pursuant to a Fee Adjustment for any year, such election shall apply to each succeeding year unless revoked or modified prior to the year to which the revocation or modification applies. In no event may the Cashless Portion exceed 80% of the amount a GP Affiliated Person would otherwise be obligated to contribute under <u>Section 3.1(a)</u>. Notwithstanding the preceding, for purposes of applying all other provisions of this Agreement (other than <u>Section 3.1(a)</u> and this <u>Section 3.2(b))</u>, if the GP Affiliated Person(s) make their Capital Contributions pursuant to a Fee Adjustment, they shall be treated as if they had made each Capital Contribution in full without reduction for any Cashless Portion; provided, however, that such GP Affiliated Person(s)’ respective Capital Accounts shall not include any Cashless Portion. It is intended that the portion of a GP Affiliated Person’s Interest that is represented by Fee Adjustment amounts, if any, constitutes a “profits interest” within the meaning of Internal Revenue Service Revenue Procedure 93-27 (1993-27 C.B. 343) and the provisions of Article 4 and Article 6 shall be implemented accordingly.   

      - Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the General Partner may accept Capital Contributions from a Partner in an amount that exceeds the amount requested by the General Partner pursuant to capital calls, including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Warehoused Investments contributed by any of the GP Affiliated Persons and the Capital Contributions of Limited Partners whose respective Commitments are less than or equal to the Minimum Commitment, as provided in <u>Section 3.2(a)</u>. The amount of capital contributed by a Partner in excess of the amount of capital that such Partner would have contributed had such Partner contributed capital as requested by the General Partner pursuant to capital calls shall be considered as an advance fulfillment of the eventual obligation of such Partner to contribute capital to the Partnership and shall not accrue interest.  Any such advanced amounts shall not (i) be treated as a Capital Contribution available to the Partnership until such time as such amounts would have been requested by the General Partner pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, or (ii) be deemed delivered to the Partnership for purposes of the right of such Partner to any allocations or distributions pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and the General Partner may make any other necessary adjustments, in good faith, to further the intended economic arrangement with respect to such advanced amounts. 

 
   1. <u> Investment Period.</u>  The General Partner may call capital pursuant to  <u>Section 3.2(a)</u>, from time to time, for new Portfolio Investments during the period commencing as of the Initial Closing and ending on the {% if fund.anniversary == 'FIRST' %}1st{% elif fund.anniversary == 'SECOND' %}2nd{% elif fund.anniversary == 'THIRD' %}3rd{% elif fund.anniversary == 'FOURTH' %}4th{% elif fund.anniversary == 'FIFTH' %}5th{% endif %} year anniversary of the Initial Closing (the “<u>Investment Period</u>”). After the expiration or termination of the Investment Period or at any time after the commencement of a Suspension until such Suspension has been lifted, the Partners will not be required to make any further Capital Contributions to the Partnership, except with respect to (a) Partnership Expenses (including indemnification obligations and the Management Fees), (b) Follow-On Investments in existing Portfolio Companies, (c) Follow-Up Investments under active consideration by the General Partner or the Management Company prior to the end of the Investment Period or, in the case of a Suspension, prior to the date of such Suspension, and (d) to satisfy any capital commitments with respect to existing investments in Underlying Funds.

   1. <u> Available Capital.</u>  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, including pursuant to <u>Section 4.10</u>, no Partner shall be obligated to contribute to the Partnership, in the aggregate, capital in excess of such Partner’s Unfunded Commitment.

   1. <u> Capital Accounts.</u> 

      - An individual capital account (“<u>Capital Account</u>”) shall be maintained for each Partner. Each Partner’s Capital Account shall be maintained by the Partnership in accordance with the following provisions:

         - Each Partner’s Capital Account shall be credited with (A) the amount of any Capital Contributions by such Partner, (B) the amount of any Partnership Liabilities assumed by the Partner or which are secured by any property distributed to such Partner, and (C) such Partner’s allocable share of Profit and, without duplication, any items in the nature of income or gain that are specifically allocated to such Partner pursuant to <u>Section 6</u> or other provisions of this Agreement. 

 
         -Each Partner’s Capital Account shall be debited by (A) the amount of cash and the Carrying Value of any property distributed (or deemed distributed) to such Partner pursuant to any provision of this Agreement, (B) such Partner’s allocable share of Loss and, without duplication, any items in the nature of expenses or losses that are specifically allocated to such Partner pursuant to <u>Section 6</u> or other provisions of this Agreement and (C) liabilities of such Partner assumed by the Partnership or which are secured by any property contributed by such Partner to the Partnership.

      - The provisions of this Agreement relating to the maintenance of Capital Accounts are intended to comply with Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b), and they shall be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with such Treasury Regulations. In the event the General Partner shall determine that it is prudent to modify the manner in which the Capital Accounts, or any debits or credits thereto, are computed in order to comply with such Treasury Regulations, the General Partner may make such modification.

   1. <u> Defaulting Partner.</u> 


        - Except as otherwise expressly provided under this Agreement, in the event that a Partner (including a GP Affiliated Person) fails to make any Capital Contribution payment required to be paid hereunder, and such failure continues for 20 days after receipt of notice of such default, then such Partner shall be in default (a “<u>Defaulting Partner</u>”) and may, at the General Partner’s sole discretion, be subject to the provisions of this <u>Section 3.6</u>.

       - Except as provided in this <u>Section 3.6(b)</u> or permitted by the General Partner, a Defaulting Partner shall not be entitled to make any further Capital Contributions to the Partnership. The General Partner may impose a default charge on the Defaulting Partner (as calculated pursuant to <u>Section 3.6(d)</u>) and will have the option to take one or more of the following steps:

           - offer each non-Defaulting Partner the opportunity to elect to increase its Commitment by its *pro rata* share of the difference between such Defaulting Partner’s Commitment and Capital Contributions, such *pro rata* share determined on the basis of such non-Defaulting Partner’s Commitment at the time of default compared to the total Commitments of all non-Defaulting Partners that elect to increase their Commitments at such time (if a non-Defaulting Partner increases its Commitment under this <u>Section 3.6(b)(i)</u>, then such non-Defaulting Partner’s Percentage Interest shall be adjusted to reflect the increased Commitment of such Partner);

           - reduce the Defaulting Partner’s Interest (including, without limitation, the Defaulting Partner’s Percentage Interest and Capital Account balance) by 50% and reallocate such reduced Percentage Interest and Capital Account among all Partners other than the Defaulting Partner *pro rata* on the basis of such non-Defaulting Partner’s Commitment at the time of default compared to the total Commitments of all non-Defaulting Partners, provided that the amount so reallocated to any Partner shall not reduce the Commitment of such non-Defaulting Partner;

         - cause a forfeiture of any portion of an Interest back to the Partnership which such Defaulting Partner was issued but had not yet paid for at the time of the default and reduce such Defaulting Partner’s Commitment to the amount such Defaulting Partner has contributed as of the date thereof, which would reduce the overall Commitments of the Partnership. In addition, the Partnership will have the authority to sell the Interest attributable to the unfulfilled Commitment to the other Limited Partners, including to any GP Affiliated Person, and/or to any third party;

         - assist the Defaulting Partner in selling its Interest in the Partnership;
            
			- accept a late Capital Contribution from the Defaulting Partner (with or without interest calculated pursuant to <u>Section 3.6(d)</u>);

         - require that, whenever the vote, consent, or decision of a Partner or of the Partners is required or permitted pursuant to this Agreement, any Defaulting Partner shall, to the extent determined by the General Partner, not be entitled to participate in such vote or consent, or to make such decision, and, to such extent determined by the General Partner, such vote, consent or decision shall be tabulated or made as if such Defaulting Partner were not a Partner; and

         - pursue and enforce all of the Partnership’s other rights and remedies against the Defaulting Partner that may exist under this Agreement or applicable law.

         Should the General Partner elect to exercise any of the provisions of this <u>Section 3.6(b)</u>, the General Partner may, in its sole discretion, require the Defaulting Partner to pay for all expenses incurred or anticipated to be incurred by the Partnership in connection with the default and the exercise of the provisions of this <u>Section 3.6(b)</u>. Until such time as the unpaid Capital Contribution, any default charge, as described in <u>Section 3.6(d)</u>, and/or any default expenses, as described in this paragraph, are paid by the Defaulting Partner to the Partnership, the General Partner may elect to withhold any or all distributions that would otherwise be made to such Defaulting Partner and recover any such unpaid Capital Contribution, default charge and/or default expenses by setoff against any such withheld distribution.  The General Partner may, in its sole discretion, (i) notify the non-Defaulting Partners of the default by the Defaulting Partner and the actions taken to remedy such default, and (ii) require each non-Defaulting Partner to make additional Capital Contributions equal to such non-Defaulting Partner’s *pro rata* share of the Defaulting Partner’s past due amount determined on the basis of such non-Defaulting Partner’s Commitment at the time of default compared to the total Commitments of all non-Defaulting Partners; provided that any such Capital Contributions by a non-Defaulting Partner shall not to exceed such non-Defaulting Partner’s Unfunded Commitment.

      - For avoidance of doubt, no right, power or remedy conferred in this <u>Section 3.6</u> shall be exclusive, and each such right, power or remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to every other right, power or remedy whether conferred in this Section 3.6 or now or hereafter available at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise. The General Partner may exercise the remedies set forth in <u>Section 3.6(b)</u> for every subsequent default by the Defaulting Partner. No course of dealing among the Partners and no delay in exercising any right, power or remedy conferred in this <u>Section 3.6</u>, or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise shall operate as a waiver or otherwise prejudice any such right, power or remedy.

      - The default charge imposed by the General Partner on a Defaulting Partner pursuant to this <u>Section 3.6</u>, if any, shall equal the lesser of (i) the Default Rate or, (ii) the highest rate permitted by applicable law, on any past due amount from the date such amount became due until the date on which such payment is received by the Partnership (by application of withheld distributions or otherwise), or such lower amount, as determined by the General Partner in its discretion. Any such default charge so paid by a Defaulting Partner shall be distributed to the non-Defaulting Partners. Amounts contributed by a Defaulting Partner in respect of the default charge as required by this <u>Section 3.6</u> shall not be considered a Capital Contribution for purposes of this Agreement.

   1. <u>Reserves.</u> The General Partner may reserve from amounts otherwise distributable to the Partners any amount the General Partner determines to be necessary to pay liabilities and obligations of the Partnership reasonably anticipated (including without limitation, Partnership Expenses) and not otherwise provided for or that the General Partner determines to be prudent to provide for any contingent liabilities of the Partnership. Any amounts so reserved that are not used shall be invested in Short-Term Holdings. The General Partner may at any time release any funds so reserved and any interest earned thereon or increment thereto and distribute them to the Partners, as provided by <u>Section 4</u>.

   1. <u>Borrowings.</u> The Partnership shall be permitted to incur debt (“<u>Bridge Financing</u>”) for any purpose for which Capital Contributions may be called under this Agreement, including, without limitation, to fund a Portfolio Investment or pay Partnership Expenses, pending the satisfaction of a capital call issued pursuant to <u>Section 3.2(a)</u>; provided that each Bridge Financing, and any other indebtedness, guarantee or leverage of the Partnership, is for a non-renewable term that is no longer than 120 days (which, for the avoidance of doubt, does not apply to any guarantee by the Partnership of obligations of a Portfolio Company, up to the amount of the Partnership’s investment in the Portfolio Company); provided, however, that any Bridge Financing, together with any issuance of debt obligations, guarantees by the Partnership of obligations of a Portfolio Company or any other leverage incurred by the Partnership, shall not exceed 15% of aggregate Commitments, and provided, further, that with respect to a capital call line of credit or other credit facility, the term Bridge Financing shall mean each draw or advance of cash with respect to the capital call line of credit or credit facility (as opposed to the capital call line of credit or credit facility itself). In connection with any such Bridge Financing, the Partnership or the General Partner may assign, pledge, charge, grant a security interest in or Transfer the right to issue drawdown notices, the right to receive and enforce Capital Contributions into an account of the Partnership (or an Alternative Investment Vehicle, as applicable), the right to any collateral account of the Partnership (or an Alternative Investment Vehicle, as applicable) into which the Capital Contributions by Partners are deposited, the right of the General Partner to exercise on its own behalf and on behalf of the Partnership any remedies contemplated by this Agreement against a Partner that defaults in its obligation under this Agreement to make Capital Contributions with respect to its Unfunded Commitment and the right to enforce any other rights, titles, powers, privileges and remedies of the Partnership or the General Partner under this Agreement, including the rights and remedies under <u>Section 3.6</u> (where applicable), to any such lender.  In the event of any such grant of security, each Limited Partner shall, upon request by the General Partner, acknowledge to any person to which such Limited Partner’s Unfunded Commitments have been granted security over as a security interest of indebtedness of the Partnership, such Limited Partner’s obligation to make its Capital Contributions up to its Unfunded Commitments in accordance with such grant of security (but subject to the terms of this Agreement), and acknowledge that such Limited Partner may be limited in its ability to use its Interest as collateral for other indebtedness or in its ability to Transfer its Interest.

   1. <u> ERISA.</u>  The General Partner shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause less than 25% of the Partnership (calculated as required by the Plan Asset Regulation) to be held by Benefit Plan Investors.  For purposes of the preceding sentence, the General Partner shall be entitled to rely on customary representations from Limited Partners, including as to their status as Benefit Plan Investors.  If the General Partner determines that the continued participation in the Partnership by a Limited Partner would result in the Partnership holding “plan assets” under Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, the General Partner may (i) withdraw some or all of such Limited Partner’s Interest (ii) require Benefit Plan Investors to invest through a feeder fund established for Benefit Plan Investors, which requires such feeder fund to invest substantially all of its assets into the Partnership.

1. #### SECTION: Partnership Distributions.

   1. <u> Withdrawal of Capital.</u>  Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, no Partner shall have the right to withdraw capital from the Partnership or to receive any distribution of or return on such Partner’s Capital Contributions.

   1. <u> Distributions.</u> 

      - Except as provided in <u>Section 3.7</u>, <u>Section 4.2(b)</u>, <u>Section 4.3</u>, <u>Section 4.4</u> and <u>Section 12.2</u>, and subject to applicable law, the Partnership will distribute Available Proceeds at such time and in such amounts as determined by the General Partner in its discretion.  Available Proceeds will be preliminarily apportioned amongst the Partners *pro rata* according to their respective aggregate Capital Contributions to the Partnership (including the amount of any Fee Adjustments in the case of the GP Affiliated Person(s) whose Capital Contributions include a Cashless Portion but only to the extent of any positive Capital Account balance of such GP Affiliated Person(s)). The amount apportioned to the GP Affiliated Person(s) will be distributed to such GP Affiliated Person(s).  The preliminary share of Available Proceeds apportioned to the Limited Partners (other than any GP Affiliated Person(s)) will be further divided between each Limited Partner and the General Partner in the following priority and manner:

          - First, 100% to the Limited Partner until such time as the Limited Partner has received aggregate distributions pursuant to this <u>Section 4.2(a)(i)</u> equal to the Limited Partner’s aggregate Capital Contributions; and

          - Thereafter, 80% to the Limited Partner and 20% to the General Partner.

       - Income from Short-Term Holdings shall be distributed *pro rata* to the Partners in accordance with Capital Contributions.

       - The General Partner shall make appropriate adjustments to the amount of Available Proceeds distributable to each Partner to take account of any payments of the Management Fee by the Partnership and any difference in the terms of the Management Fee with respect to each of the Partners.

       - Except with respect to a Limited Partner that is a GP Affiliated Person, the General Partner may withdraw all or any portion of the Interests held by any Limited Partner at any time, (i) with the consent of a Majority in Interest of the Limited Partners and such Limited Partner, for an amount agreed with such Limited Partner or (ii) pursuant to <u>Section 13.6</u>.

    1. <u> Reinvestment.</u>  In connection with the  Partnership’s receipt of proceeds from the disposition of a Portfolio Investment, or portion thereof, or distribution from a Portfolio Investment during the Investment Period, the General Partner shall be authorized to either (a) reinvest (or reserve for reinvestment) all or part of such proceeds, or use (or reserve) all or part of such proceeds for the payment of Partnership Expenses (including the Management Fee), or (b) make one or more distributions to the Partners that increase each Partner’s Unfunded Commitment by an amount equal to the amounts distributed to it (and such amounts will be subject to recall by the Partnership for any purpose that Capital Contributions may be called), provided, that notice of any distribution subject to recall is provided to the Limited Partners in advance of the Partnership making such distribution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the aggregate cost basis of all Portfolio Investments made by the Partnership will not exceed 120% of aggregate Commitments.

   1. <u> Tax Distributions.</u>  Notwithstanding <u>Section 4.2</u>, but subject to the amount of Available Proceeds, with respect to each Fiscal Year (or other relevant period), the General Partner is entitled to receive cash distributions from the Partnership (after taking into account any other distributions received by the General Partner in such Fiscal Year (or other relevant period)) in amounts sufficient to enable the General Partner and the members of the General Partner to discharge any tax liabilities (including estimated tax liabilities) arising as a result of the General Partner’s Carried Interest, determined by assuming the applicability of the Combined Tax Rate. Such distributions will reduce the distributions of Carried Interest to which the General Partner is otherwise entitled to pursuant to <u>Section 4.2</u>.

   1. <u>Distributions In Kind.</u> Prior to the winding up and dissolution of the Partnership, the General Partner may distribute (i) cash or Marketable Securities as distributions in kind, and (ii) securities or other property other than cash or Marketable Securities, including without limitation, any Digital Asset and/or limited partnership interest in an Underlying Fund, with the prior approval of the Advisory Committee or a Majority in Interest of the Limited Partners. Upon the winding up and dissolution of the Partnership, the General Partner may distribute cash, Marketable Securities and any other securities or other property as distributions in kind pursuant to <u>Section 12.3</u>. In the event that a distribution of Marketable Securities or other securities or property is made, such securities or property shall be deemed to have been sold at their fair market value measured on the date of such distribution and the available proceeds of such sale shall be deemed to have been distributed as Available Proceeds to the Partners pursuant to <u>Section 4.2</u>. Distributions of Marketable Securities and, subject to the terms of this <u>Section 4.5</u>, distributions of any other securities or other property shall be made in proportion to the aggregate amounts that would be distributed to each Partner pursuant to <u>Section 4.2</u>, as determined by the General Partner in its discretion. The General Partner may cause certificates evidencing any securities (other than Marketable Securities) to be distributed to be imprinted with legends as to such restrictions on transfer as it may determine are necessary or appropriate, including legends as to applicable securities laws or other legal or contractual restrictions, and may require any Partner to which securities are to be distributed, as a condition to such distribution, to agree in writing (a) that such Partner will not transfer such securities except in compliance with such restrictions and (b) to such other matters as the General Partner may determine are necessary or appropriate.

   1. <u> Limit on Distributions.</u>  Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, no distribution shall be declared or paid if such distribution would violate the limitations on distributions in the Act or any other applicable law or if, after giving effect to the proposed distribution, (a) the liabilities of the Partnership would exceed the fair market value of the assets of the Partnership or (b) the Partnership would be unable to pay its debts as they come due in the ordinary course of business.

   1. <u> Withholding Taxes;</u>  Tax Payments. If the Partnership is required by law to pay any tax that is specifically attributable to any Partner (or direct or indirect shareholder, member, or other owner of such Partner), including withholding taxes, state unincorporated business taxes, taxes imposed on the Partnership in respect of such Partner under Section 1446(f), and payments required to be made by the Partnership in connection with the Partnership Audit Provisions, then such Partner shall indemnify and reimburse the Partnership for such tax (and any related interest and penalties).  The Partnership may offset distributions and other amounts which any Partner is otherwise entitled to receive under this Agreement against a Partner’s indemnification obligations under this <u>Section 4.7</u> and, to the extent offset, such amount shall for all purposes of this Agreement (other than as necessary to properly maintain Capital Accounts or to properly determine the allocations of Profits and Losses) be treated as distributed or otherwise paid to such Partner.  A Partner’s obligation to pay or indemnify for a tax (and related interest and penalties) shall survive the Partner selling or otherwise disposing of its interest in the Partnership and the termination, dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the Partnership.  Any indemnity or payment pursuant to this <u>Section 4.7</u> shall not be a Capital Contribution but shall to the extent necessary to properly maintain Capital Accounts, increase a Partner’s Capital Account.

   
   1.  </u> Other.</u>
  

      - If the General Partner determines that a proposed use of Capital Contributions in respect of which the Partners have made Capital Contributions will not be consummated, the General Partner shall either (i) refund to the Partners that made such Capital Contributions the amounts of such Capital Contributions, including any earnings thereon, within 90 days of such determination or (ii) retain such amounts for any Partnership purpose. If any Capital Contributions are returned pursuant to this <u>Section 4.8(a)</u>, such Capital Contributions shall be treated as if never made to the Partnership and appropriate adjustments shall be made to the Unfunded Commitments of the Partners.

      - The General Partner, in its discretion, may elect not to receive part or all of any distribution to which it otherwise would be entitled and instead cause that amount to be retained by the Partnership or distributed to all Partners (or to all Limited Partners) in proportion to their respective Percentage Interests; provided, however, that the General Partner may, in its discretion, subsequently distribute amounts to itself until the cumulative amount distributed to each Partner equals the amount that would have been distributed had the General Partner not waived prior distributions pursuant this <u>Section 4.8(b)</u>.

     1. <u>General Partner Clawback.</u> As promptly as practicable (but not more than 90 days) after the liquidation of the Partnership, the General Partner shall determine, whether there was an Over Distribution. An “<u>Over Distribution</u>” means the positive amount determined by subtracting (i) the cumulative distributions that would have been received by the General Partner as Carried Interest determined as though the Partnership retained all of the Partnership’s distributions to the Partners since inception and made a single distribution to the Partners on the date of the Partnership’s final distribution pursuant to <u>Section 12.3</u>, from (ii) the cumulative distributions that the General Partner actually received as Carried Interest over the Partnership’s term. In the event there is an Over Distribution, the General Partner shall contribute to the Partnership for distribution to all Limited Partners *pro rata* in accordance with their respective Percentage Interest the amount of the Over Distribution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the General Partner be required to restore, pursuant to this <u>Section 4.9</u>, more than the cumulative Carried Interest distributions received by the General Partner less taxes imposed on such amounts of allocations related thereto, determined using the Combined Tax Rate.

   1. <u>Return of Distributions.</u> If the Partnership incurs any Liability (including in the event that the Partnership is obligated to return any distributions received by the Partnership from an Underlying Fund) and the amount of reserves, if any, specifically identified by the Partnership with respect to such Liability and the Unfunded Commitments at such time (less any amounts reserved for Follow-On Investments in Portfolio Companies, Follow-Up Investments, unfunded commitments to the Underlying Funds and Partnership Expenses, in each case reasonably anticipated by the General Partner at such time) are in the aggregate less than the amount of such Liability, the General Partner may, at any time or from time to time, whether before or after dissolution of the Partnership or before or after a Partner’s withdrawal from the Partnership, recall distributions (excluding previously recalled distributions) made pursuant to this Agreement *pro rata* according to the amount by which such Liability would have reduced the distributions received by the Partners had such Liability been incurred by the Partnership prior to the time such distributions were made; provided, that with respect to the return of a distribution that was made in-kind, each Limited Partner may, at its option, return either identical property or cash equal to the lesser of: (i) the fair market value of such property at the time of distribution; or (ii) the fair market value of such property at the due time of such return; provided, however, that in no event shall any Partner be required to contribute amounts pursuant to this <u>Section 4.10</u> that exceed more than the lesser of (a) 25% of such Partner’s Commitment and (b) the aggregate distributions received by such Partner from the Partnership; provided, further that no Partner will be required to contribute amounts, pursuant to this <u>Section 4.10</u>, three years after the termination of the Partnership, unless the General Partner notifies the Limited Partners that there is a threatened or pending Liability within such time period, then the obligation of the Partners to return distributions to the Partnership shall survive with respect to the Liabilities described in the notice until the date that each such Liability is resolved. Any repayment of distributions pursuant to this <u>Section 4.10</u> shall not constitute Capital Contributions for purposes of determining the Unfunded Commitment of any Limited Partner, but shall be treated as returns of distributions and reductions in Available Proceeds, in making subsequent distributions pursuant to <u>Sections 4.2</u> and <u>12.3</u> and in determining the amount that the General Partner is required to contribute to the Partnership pursuant to <u>Section 4.9</u>, provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt, (x) any returns of distributions pursuant to this <u>Section 4.10</u> shall be made such that the amount the General Partner retains does not exceed the amount the General Partner would have received had the aggregate amount not returned been the total amount originally distributed in accordance with <u>Section 4.2</u>, and (y) if distributions are returned pursuant to this <u>Section 4.10</u> after the winding-up of the Partnership, then the amount which the General Partner is required to pay to the Partnership pursuant to <u>Section 4.9</u>, if any, shall be recalculated to take into account the amount of distributions returned, and if such recalculation would result in the General Partner paying a greater amount than it otherwise paid pursuant to <u>Section 4.9</u>, the amount of distributions which the General Partner may recall pursuant to this <u>Section 4.10</u> shall be reduced by such excess.  Nothing in this <u>Section 4.10</u> is intended to expand the rights of Protected Persons to indemnification, contribution or reimbursement pursuant to <u>Section 7.4</u>. A Partner’s obligation to make contributions to the Partnership under this <u>Section 4.10</u> shall survive the termination, liquidation, winding up and dissolution of the Partnership, subject to any limitations on survival expressed elsewhere in this <u>Section 4.10</u>, and the Partnership (or, following dissolution of the Partnership, the General Partner) may pursue and enforce all rights and remedies it may have against each Partner under this <u>Section 4.10</u>. All amounts recalled pursuant to <u>Section 4.10</u> shall be deemed a reduction of the amounts distributed under <u>Section 4.2</u> by such amount.

1. #### SECTION: Management; CONFLICTS OF INTEREST; OTHER VEHICLES.

   1. <u>Management Generally.</u>

      - The management and control of the Partnership shall be vested exclusively in the General Partner, subject to <u>Section 5.1(b)</u>. The Limited Partners, as such, shall not take part in the conduct of the business of the Partnership and shall not participate in the control, management, direction or operation of the activities or affairs of the Partnership and shall have no power to act for or bind the Partnership; provided that the foregoing shall not limit the ability of the Limited Partners, to the extent expressly provided in this Agreement, to possess or exercise any of the powers, or have or act in any capacities, permitted under Section 17-303(b) of the Act.

      - The General Partner intends to, on behalf of the Partnership, enter into an investment management agreement with the Management Company, whereby the General Partner will delegate certain investment and operational duties to the Management Company in consideration for the Management Fee payable by the Partnership pursuant to <u>Section 8.1(a)</u>.

   1. <u>Powers of the General Partner.</u>

      - The General Partner shall have full and complete authority of all affairs of the Partnership, and the management and control of the Partnership’s operations shall rest exclusively with the General Partner, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the delegation of certain services as set forth in <u>Section 5.1(b)</u>. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, General Partner shall have the power on behalf of and in the name of the Partnership to carry out any and all of the objects and purposes of the Partnership in accordance with, and subject to the limitations contained in, this Agreement and to perform all acts which the General Partner, in its discretion, may deem necessary, desirable or appropriate in connection therewith and with the business and operations of the Partnership, including without limitation the power to:

         - make, enter into and perform subscription agreements, side letters, limited partnership agreements, limited liability company agreements and similar arrangements, including any amendments thereto or documents contemplated thereby, without any further act, vote or approval of any Partner;

         - borrow on behalf of the Partnership or any Portfolio Company, grant security over the assets of the Partnership, and, as required, cause the Partnership to guarantee the obligations of a Portfolio Company;

         - acquire liability or other insurance to protect the Partnership and the Portfolio Companies;

         - deposit, withdraw, invest, pay, retain and distribute the Partnership’s funds in a manner consistent with the provisions of this Agreement;

         - bring or defend, pay, collect, compromise, arbitrate, resort to legal action, or otherwise adjust claims or demands of or against the Partnership (including without limitation claims against former or current Limited Partners);

         - make, enter into and perform such agreements and undertakings as may be necessary or advisable to the carrying out of any of the foregoing powers, objects or purposes; and

         - do and perform all other acts as may be necessary or appropriate to the conduct of the Partnership.

      - Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or otherwise applicable provision of law (common or statutory) or equitable principle, (a) whenever in this Agreement the General Partner is permitted or required to make a decision in its “discretion” or under a grant of similar authority or latitude, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the General Partner shall be entitled to consider only such interests and factors as it desires, including its own interests, and shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, have no duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of or factors affecting the Partnership or the Limited Partners (provided that the General Partner shall always exercise such discretion, and otherwise act under this Agreement, consistently with its fiduciary duty to the Partnership and the Limited Partners), and (b) whenever in this Agreement the General Partner is permitted or required to make a decision in its “good faith” or under another express standard, the General Partner shall act under such express standard and shall not be subject to any other or different standards.

      - Without limiting the generality of <u>Section 5.2(a)</u>, no Limited Partner shall have the right to approve, disapprove or otherwise control any decision to invest in or divest the securities of Portfolio Companies taken by the Management Company on behalf of, or with respect to, the Partnership or the decisions made by the Management Company related to entities in which the Partnership has invested for purposes of, and within the meaning of, the U.S. Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended from time to time (or any corresponding provisions of succeeding law) (the “<u>DPA</u>”), including as amended and/or supplemented by Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018, as amended from time to time (or any corresponding provisions of succeeding law) (“<u>FIRRMA</u>”), and the rules and regulations promulgated under the DPA and FIRRMA (the “<u>CFIUS Regulations</u>”), or to otherwise cause the indirect interest of a “foreign person” (as defined by the DPA and/or the CFIUS Regulations) through the Partnership in any Portfolio Company to constitute a “covered transaction” (as defined by the DPA and/or the CFIUS Regulations), and the role of, and restrictions on, the Limited Partners provided for in this Agreement shall be construed in a manner consistent with such intention. Without the approval of the Advisory Committee or a Majority in Interest of the Limited Partners, no Limited Partner shall have the right to, or be granted, (i) membership or observer rights on the board of directors or equivalent governing body of any Portfolio Company or a right to nominate an individual to a position on such body; (ii) access to any “material nonpublic technical information” (as defined by the DPA and/or the CFIUS Regulations) in the possession of any Portfolio Company; or (iii) any involvement in substantive decision making of any Portfolio Company regarding the use, development, acquisition, or release of “critical technologies,” “sensitive data” and/or “critical infrastructure” (as such terms are used or referred to in the DPA and/or the CFIUS Regulations).

   1. <u>Investment Restrictions.</u> Without the approval of the Advisory Committee or a Majority in Interest of the Limited Partners, the Partnership will not invest more than 15% of the aggregate Commitments and capital commitments of any Parallel Fund (determined on a cost basis at the time of investment) in any single Portfolio Investment; provided that, prior to the final Subsequent Closing, the aggregate Commitments and capital commitments of any Parallel Funds shall be measured based on the greater of (i) actual aggregate Commitments and capital commitments of any Parallel Fund or (ii) the Target Commitment.  In addition, the Partnership will not invest more than 20% of the actual aggregate Commitments and capital commitments of any Parallel Fund (determined on a cost basis at the time of investment) in Underlying Funds and/or Other Investments.

   1. <u>Acknowledgments by Limited Partners.</u>

      - Each Limited Partner acknowledges that decisions regarding the Partnership’s operations, while involving the exercise of the General Partner’s judgment, also involve the risk of loss of the Partnership’s capital. Each Limited Partner hereby authorizes the General Partner to exercise its judgment and discretion in making decisions on the Partnership’s behalf. 
 
      - To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the General Partner shall not be limited by any law now or hereafter in effect or customs limiting the investments that may be made or retained by entities similar to the Partnership, and the General Partner shall have no liability even if a Portfolio Investment does not produce income or is of a character or in an amount not considered proper for the investment of funds by entities similar to the Partnership.

   1. <u>Partner Meetings; Written Consents.</u>

      - Meetings of the Limited Partners may be called by the General Partner from time to time, in its discretion. Notice of any such meeting shall be delivered to all Partners in the manner prescribed in <u>Section 13.10</u> not fewer than 10 days before the date of such meeting. The notice shall state the place, date, hour and purpose or purposes of the meeting. Such meeting shall be held in person at the principal office of the Partnership or at such other place as may be designated by the General Partner or telephonically or through the use of other means of communication by which all Persons participating in the meeting can communicate with each other, including without limitation via videoconference.  At each meeting of the Limited Partners, the General Partner shall adopt such rules for the conduct of such meeting as it shall deem appropriate. The expenses of any such meeting, including the cost of providing notice thereof (but not the travel costs and expenses of Limited Partners and their representatives), shall be borne by the Partnership.  

      - Whenever Limited Partners are required or permitted to take any action by vote or at a meeting, such action may be taken without a meeting or without a vote, if a written consent setting forth the action so taken is signed by the Limited Partners owning not less than the minimum number of Interests that would be necessary to authorize or take such action by vote or at a meeting and provided that five days’ prior written notice of the solicitation of such consents is given to all of the Limited Partners. Notice of any action so taken by written consent shall be given by the General Partner to all Partners, in the manner prescribed in <u>Section 13.10</u>, promptly after the taking of such action. 

   1. <u>Key Person Event.</u>

      - A “<u>Key Person Event</u>” shall be deemed to occur in the event that {% if fund.principalsNumber === '1'%}the Principal,{%endif%} {% if fund.principalsNumber === '2'%}one of the two Principals,{%endif%}{% if fund.principalsNumber === '3'%}two of the three Principals,{%endif%}{% if fund.principalsNumber === '4'%}three of the four Principals,{%endif%} prior to the sooner to occur of the end of the Investment Period or the date of the initial closing of a Permitted Successor Fund, (i) transfer(s) more than 50% of his/her interest in the General Partner (other than to an affiliate or for tax planning purposes), (ii) die(s) or (iii) cease(s) to be actively involved with the business and affairs of the Partnership for a period of 180 consecutive days. If at any time, a Key Person Event occurs, the General Partner will give prompt written notice to the Limited Partners, and the Investment Period shall automatically be suspended (a “<u>Suspension</u>”).  Upon a Suspension, without the prior written consent of the Advisory Committee or a Majority in Interest of the Limited Partners, the Partnership shall be prohibited from making new investments, other than Follow-On Investments approved by the Advisory Committee or a Majority in Interest of the Limited Partners or Follow-Up Investments under active consideration by the General Partner or the Management Company prior to such Key Person Event.

       - After the commencement of a Suspension, the Advisory Committee or a Majority in Interest of the Limited Partners will have 180 days from the date of the Key Person Event to approve a remediation plan for such Key Person Event, which, once implemented, would lift the Suspension and allow the Partnership to recommence normal investment activities.  If the Advisory Committee or a Majority in Interest of the Limited Partners does not approve a remediation plan for such Key Person Event within 180 days of the date of the Key Person Event, then the Investment Period shall automatically and immediately be terminated, unless, within such 180-day period, the Advisory Committee or a Majority in Interest of the Limited Partners vote to lift the Suspension and allow the Partnership to recommence normal investment activities.  
  
   1. <u>Removal of the General Partner for Cause.</u>

      - The General Partner may be removed or replaced within 30 days following the occurrence of Cause, if the finding of such Cause is not cured pursuant to <u>Section 5.7(c)</u>, by the election of Two-Thirds in Interest of the Limited Partners.  

      - Any such removal of the General Partner will become effective 30 days following delivery of written notice of such vote to the General Partner; provided that Two-Thirds in Interest of the Limited Partners shall have approved a replacement General Partner prior to the effective date of such removal.

      - The term “<u>Cause</u>” means a finding (other than a temporary, preliminary or similar injunction) on the merits that the General Partner, the Management Company or any of the Principal(s) has (i) committed embezzlement or fraud or acted in bad faith, (ii) committed a material breach of applicable law in connection with the performance of their respective duties under this Agreement, or (iii) committed a material breach of this Agreement, which in the case of (ii) or (iii) has a material adverse effect on the business of the Partnership. The General Partner (or the Management Company if such finding of Cause relates to the Management Company), shall be deemed to have cured any finding of Cause if it terminates or otherwise removes from active participation with the General Partner, the Management Company and their respective Affiliates all individuals, including any of the Principal(s), who engaged in the conduct constituting such Cause (the “<u>Offending Persons</u>”) within 30 days after the determination that such event constitutes Cause and has made the Partnership whole for any direct economic loss to the Partnership resulting from such event that constitutes Cause.

      - If a finding of Cause is cured pursuant to <u>Section 5.7(c)</u>, with respect to the Capital Account of the General Partner, any accrued allocations of Carried Interest in respect of the Partnership held by an Offending Person as a member of the General Partner will be forfeited by such Offending Person upon his removal. Any new Principal admitted as a member of the General Partner following a removal of an Offending Person, or if there is no new Principal, the remaining Principal(s), shall receive Carried Interest from the Carried Interest foregone by such Offending Person in an amount and structure based on a recommendation made by the General Partner and approved by the Advisory Committee or a Majority in Interest of the Limited Partners.

      - In the event the General Partner is removed pursuant to <u>Section 5.7(a)</u>, the General Partner shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a Limited Partner with a Capital Account balance equal to the former General Partner’s Capital Account on the date of removal. The former General Partner shall have no Carried Interest with respect to Portfolio Investments made by the Partnership after the date of removal but with respect to Portfolio Investments made prior to such removal date, shall continue to receive Carried Interest distributions under <u>Section 4.2</u> as if it had not been removed as a the General Partner. The former General Partner shall remain entitled to indemnification, in its capacity as the General Partner, from the Partnership pursuant to <u>Section 7.4</u> with respect to any matter arising prior to its removal and shall have no liability to the Partnership as the General Partner in respect of any matter arising after its removal as the General Partner, unless such matter is caused by an act of the former General Partner that occurred prior to such removal date.  Promptly following the General Partner’s removal, the investment management agreement between the Partnership and the Management Company shall be terminated and the replacement General Partner shall retain the services of a new Management Company. 

   1. <u>Advisory Committee.</u>

      - The General Partner may form an advisory committee (an “<u>Advisory Committee</u>”) of representatives of certain Limited Partners of the Partnership.  If an Advisory Committee is formed, the Advisory Committee representatives would be selected from time to time by the General Partner, and not more than one of whom shall be a representative of any single Limited Partner. The Advisory Committee would initially have at least three and up to five voting members, although the General Partner may increase the number of Advisory Committee voting members, at any time, in its sole discretion.  None of the voting members of the Advisory Committee may be GP Affiliated Persons. The General Partner shall be entitled to remove, at any time in its discretion, an Advisory Committee member. The Advisory Committee shall perform the duties expressly contemplated in this Agreement and shall provide such other advice and counsel as is requested by the General Partner; provided that, except as specifically provided otherwise in this Agreement, the General Partner shall retain ultimate responsibility for making all decisions relating to the operation and management of the Partnership or relating to the conduct of its business, including making all operational decisions. All Advisory Committee approvals, disapprovals, determinations and other actions shall be authorized by a majority of the Advisory Committee voting members pursuant to a meeting or written consent of a majority of the Advisory Committee voting members. Meetings of the Advisory Committee members may be conducted in person, telephonically or through the use of other means of communication by which all Persons participating in the meeting can communicate with each other, including without limitation via videoconference. The General Partner shall be entitled to have a representative attend and participate in all Advisory Committee meetings as a non-voting president and may permit non-voting observers to attend such meetings, unless specifically requested otherwise by the Advisory Committee. The Partnership would reimburse each Advisory Committee member for his or her reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the proceedings of the Advisory Committee. Expenses reasonably incurred by the Advisory Committee in connection with the performance of its duties and obligations contemplated in this Agreement would be paid for or reimbursed by the Partnership.

      - The Advisory Committee, if formed, would (i) review and approve all affiliated transactions, (ii) review and approve other matters as reasonably determined by the General Partner to involve a conflict of interest and (iii) give such other approvals, waivers and consents and take such other action as contemplated under this Agreement; provided that the activities of the Advisory Committee and members thereof (acting in such capacity) shall not take part in the conduct of the business and affairs of the Partnership or in any way interfere in the conduct of business of or management of the Partnership. No member of the Advisory Committee shall be deemed to be taking part in the conduct of the business of the Partnership by serving as a member of the Advisory Committee, which covers the giving of any advice or consent (or non-consent, as the case may be) by an Advisory Committee member. Neither the Advisory Committee nor any member thereof (acting in such capacity) shall have the power to bind the Partnership or any authority to act for the Partnership or on its behalf. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Advisory Committee waives any conflict of interest or the General Partner acts in a manner, or pursuant to the standards and procedures, approved by the Advisory Committee with respect to a conflict of interest, then the General Partner and its Affiliates shall not have any liability to the Partnership or the Limited Partners for such actions taken in good faith by them.

      - The members of the Advisory Committee, if formed, shall exercise their best judgment in carrying out their functions for the Partnership. To the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law, neither the members of the Advisory Committee nor the Limited Partners on behalf of whom such members act as representatives shall owe any duties (fiduciary or otherwise) to the Partnership or any Limited Partner in respect of the activities of the Advisory Committee, other than the duty to act in good faith. Any Advisory Committee member who is the representative of any Limited Partner may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, in all instances act in such member’s own interest and in the interest of the Limited Partner that appointed such member, and, in so doing, shall be deemed to have fulfilled its duty to act in good faith. Each member and former member of the Advisory Committee (and each Limited Partner that appointed such member) shall be indemnified in accordance with <u>Section 7.4</u>. Such indemnification shall survive the resignation or removal of any Advisory Committee member with respect to actions or omissions while a member of the Advisory Committee.

      - The duties and functions of the Advisory Committee, if formed, would not be intended to provide the Advisory Committee with the ability to approve, disapprove or otherwise control any decision to invest in or divest the securities of Portfolio Companies taken by the Management Company on behalf of, or with respect to, the Partnership or the decisions made by the Management Company related to entities in which the Partnership has invested for purposes of, and within the meaning of, the DPA, including as amended and/or supplemented by FIRRMA, and the CFIUS Regulations, or to otherwise cause the indirect interest of a “foreign person” (as defined by the DPA and the CFIUS Regulations) through the Partnership in any Portfolio Company to constitute a “covered transaction” within the meaning of the CFIUS Regulations, and the duties and functions of the Advisory Committee (or any particular Advisory Committee member or representative observer thereof) shall be construed in a manner consistent with such intention. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither any Limited Partner, nor the Advisory Committee, nor any Advisory Committee member or observer shall have the right to, or be granted, access to any “material nonpublic technical information” in the possession of any Portfolio Company or any involvement in substantive decision making of any Portfolio Company regarding the use, development, acquisition, or release of “critical technologies,” “sensitive data” and/or “critical infrastructure” (as such terms are used or referred to in the DPA and/or the CFIUS Regulations).

   1. <u>Other Business Relationships; Conflicts of Interest; Warehoused Investments.</u>

      - Each of the General Partner, the Management Company and the Principal(s) will devote such time as it deems reasonably necessary to manage the affairs of the Partnership in a manner consistent with the objectives of the Partnership.

      - Subject to <u>Section 5.8</u>, the Limited Partners acknowledge that the General Partner may be subject to various conflicts of interest relating to the operations of the Partnership, including where other accounts or vehicles managed by one or more of the GP Affiliated Person(s) have investment programs or operations that are similar to or overlap with that of the Partnership. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, each of the GP Affiliated Persons, individually or with others, may engage in other investment(s) or business venture(s) of any kind, and no GP Affiliated Person shall be obligated to offer to the Partnership or any Limited Partner any opportunity to participate in any such other investment(s) or business venture(s).  Neither the Partnership nor any Limited Partner shall have any right to any income or profit derived from any such other investment(s) and/or business venture(s) of a GP Affiliated Person.

      - Notwithstanding anything set forth herein, one or more of the Principal(s), the Management Company or the General Partner may provide consulting or other services to companies, which may include the Portfolio Companies, and may receive a fee or other compensation for such services. Any consulting or other service fees or compensation paid by a Portfolio Company to a Principal, the General Partner or the Management Company {%if consultingTeamMember === 'YES'%}will not{%endif%}{%if consultingTeamMember === 'NO'%}will{%endif%} be deemed Offset Fees for purposes of <u>Section 8.1(c)</u>. 

      - Subject to <u>Section 5.13</u>, during the Investment Period, the General Partner will present to the Partnership all investment opportunities that, in the reasonable good faith judgment of the General Partner, meet the Partnership’s investment criteria if (i) such investment opportunities are available to the Partnership and (ii) the Partnership is otherwise able to make such investments; provided that following the commencement of any Permitted Successor Fund, investment opportunities will be allocated between the Partnership and any such Permitted Successor Fund in such manner as the General Partner determines to be equitable at the time of any such investment, taking into account Unfunded Commitments, reserves for Follow-On Investments, Follow-Up Investments and Partnership Expenses, the likely holding period of such investment and such other factors as the General Partner reasonably determines are relevant.

      - Prior to the Initial Closing, one (1) or more of the GP Affiliated Persons acquired directly, or through one (1) or more special purpose vehicles formed to warehouse Portfolio Compan(ies) for the Partnership (“<u>GP Affiliated Person SPV(s)</u>”), securities of the Portfolio Compan(ies) previously disclosed by the General Partner as investments warehoused for the Partnership (“<u>Warehoused Investment(s)</u>”).  Each GP Affiliated Person that held, or holds, the securities of the Warehoused Investment(s) directly, or that held, or holds, an interest in the GP Affiliated Person SPV(s) related to the Warehoused Investment(s), has contributed, or will contribute, the securities of the Warehoused Investment(s) or the GP Affiliated Person’s interest in the GP Affiliated Person SPV(s), in kind to the Partnership at the Initial Closing and/or at one (1) or more Subsequent Closings to satisfy future capital calls from the General Partner (i.e., in lieu of contributing cash to satisfy the capital call(s), such GP Affiliated Person shall be deemed to be contributing the Warehoused Investment(s) in kind to satisfy the capital call(s)).  On or about the time that the Warehoused Investment(s) were, or will be, contributed to the Partnership, the General Partner and/or the Management Company assigned, or will assign, a fair market value to the securities of the Warehoused Investment(s) and/or the membership interest(s) of the GP Affiliated Person SPV(s), as applicable.  Each GP Affiliated Person that transferred, or will transfer, its securities of the Warehoused Investment(s) and/or the membership interest in the GP Affiliated Person SPV(s) to the Partnership was, or will be, deemed to have made a Capital Contribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of the securities of the Warehoused Investment(s) and/or the membership interest of the GP Affiliated Person SPV(s), and such GP Affiliated Person’s Unfunded Commitment was, or will be, reduced by the fair market value of the securities of the Warehoused Investment(s) and/or the membership interest of the GP Affiliated Person SPV(s).

   1. <u>Co-Investments.</u> The Partnership, in the discretion of the General Partner, may offer co-investment opportunities to one or more third parties and/or one or more Limited Partners where excess investment opportunity exists after the Partnership has invested an appropriate amount (as determined by the General Partner in its discretion). Co-investment opportunities will be offered on such terms as the General Partner determines in its discretion and may be offered pursuant to one or more special purpose vehicles or co-investment vehicles.

   1. <u>Alternative Investment Vehicles.</u>

      - The General Partner has the right but not the obligation in connection with any Portfolio Investment to direct the Capital Contributions of some or all of the Limited Partners to be made through one or more alternative investment vehicles (any such structure or vehicle, an “<u>Alternative Investment Vehicle</u>”), to the extent permitted by the laws and regulations applicable to the relevant Limited Partner, if, in the judgment of the General Partner, the use of any such Alternative Investment Vehicle would allow the Partnership to address legal or regulatory considerations or invest in a more tax efficient manner and/or would facilitate participating in certain types of investments. Partners participating in an Alternative Investment Vehicle shall make contributions directly to such Alternative Investment Vehicle at the same time, to the same extent, and for the same purposes and on substantially similar terms and conditions as Partners are required to make Capital Contributions to the Partnership, and such contributions shall reduce the Unfunded Commitments of the Partners to the same extent as if Capital Contributions were made to the Partnership with respect thereto. Each such Partner shall have a substantially similar economic interest in a Portfolio Investment funded pursuant to this <u>Section 5.11(a)</u> as such Partner would have if such Portfolio Investment had been made solely by the Partnership, and such Alternative Investment Vehicle shall have terms and conditions that are substantially similar to those of the Partnership. Such Alternative Investment Vehicle (or the entity in which such Alternative Investment Vehicle invests) shall provide for the limited liability of its members or limited partners as a matter of the organizational documents of such Alternative Investment Vehicle (or the entity in which such Alternative Investment Vehicle invests), and the Management Company, the General Partner, or an Affiliate thereof, shall serve as the manager (or in a substantially similar capacity) or as investment adviser with respect to such Alternative Investment Vehicle. 

      - The determination of distributions and allocations pursuant to <u>Section 4</u> and <u>Section 6</u> (and payment of the Management Fee) shall be calculated by treating the funding of any Portfolio Investment by any Alternative Investment Vehicle as having been made by the Partnership. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such distributions and allocations with respect to a particular Alternative Investment Vehicle may be calculated separately from those of the Partnership (and vice versa) if such aggregation would increase the likelihood of any tax consequences or legal or regulatory constraints or create contractual or business risk that would be undesirable for the Partnership or any of its Partners in the determination of the General Partner.

      - The General Partner has the right but not the obligation in connection with any Portfolio Investment to direct the Partnership to invest through one or more special purpose vehicles, including in one or more subsidiaries that will be treated as either U.S. or foreign corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes, to the extent permitted by the laws and regulations applicable to the Partnership, if, in the judgment of the General Partner, the use of any such special purpose vehicle would allow the Partnership to address legal or regulatory considerations or invest in a more tax efficient manner and/or would facilitate participating in certain types of investments. 

   1. <u>Parallel Funds.</u> The General Partner or its Affiliates may form one or more entities that will invest alongside the Partnership on a parallel basis (each, a “<u>Parallel Fund</u>”), with structures that may differ from that of the Partnership, in order to facilitate the making of Portfolio Investments by certain categories of Partners (including non-U.S. persons) to accommodate legal, tax, regulatory or other considerations of any such Partner. Unless there are legal, tax, regulatory or other considerations in respect of a Parallel Fund and the Partnership, a Parallel Fund will invest in all of the Portfolio Investments on a side-by-side basis with the Partnership on a proportionate basis with the Partnership based on commitments, and each investment by a Parallel Fund will be made and disposed of on substantially the same terms as the Partnership. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Parallel Fund shall not be required to make an investment in a Portfolio Company if the Portfolio Company has notified the General Partner in writing that it will not permit such Parallel Fund to invest on the same terms as the Partnership. Any Parallel Fund formed pursuant to this <u>Section 5.12</u> shall, on a *pro rata* basis by aggregate commitments, be allocated and shall bear its share of the Partnership Expenses other than the Management Fee.  In the event that the General Partner or its Affiliate forms one or more Parallel Funds, the General Partner shall have full authority, without the consent of any Person, including any Partner, (a) to amend this Agreement as may be necessary or appropriate in the good faith judgment of the General Partner to facilitate the formation and operation of such Parallel Fund and the investments contemplated by this <u>Section 5.12</u>, provided that no such amendment shall be materially adverse to the Limited Partners, and (b) to interpret in good faith any provision of this Agreement, whether or not so amended, to give effect to the intent of the provisions of this <u>Section 5.12</u>.  The General Partner shall make all appropriate adjustments as may be necessary or otherwise appropriate to give effect to the intent of this <u>Section 5.12</u>.  The Limited Partners shall execute any and all documents as the General Partner shall reasonably request or that are otherwise required to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this <u>Section 5.12</u>.  

   1. <u>Permitted Successor Funds.</u> None of the Principal(s), the General Partner, the Management Company or any of their respective Affiliates may act as the sponsor or investment manager of, or the primary source of transactions on behalf of, a newly created or later acquired pooled investment vehicle (other than a Parallel Fund, Alternative Investment Vehicle, co-investment vehicle and/or special purpose vehicle), which follows an investment strategy substantially similar to that followed by the Partnership until the earlier to occur of (a) the end of the Investment Period, (b) the winding up and dissolution of the Partnership or (c) the date on which 75% of the Commitments have been invested, committed or allocated to or reserved for Portfolio Investments (including any Follow-On Investments and/or Follow-Up Investments) and/or reasonably anticipated Partnership Expenses and obligations or liabilities of the Partnership (each such permitted pooled investment vehicle, hereinafter referred to as a “<u>Permitted Successor Fund</u>”).

   1. <u>Administrator. </u>

      - The General Partner has retained the Administrator to serve as the Partnership’s fund administrator.  The Administrator performs certain administrative and accounting services for the Partnership, subject to the overall supervision of the General Partner, and the Partnership shall pay the Administrator fees for such services, as described in the Administration Agreement.  The Administrator is a service provider to the Partnership and, except for the reports and statements prepared by the Administrator, the Administrator is not responsible for the information or any materials that are provided by the Principal(s), the General Partner, the Management Company or their Affiliates to prospective investors or Limited Partners.  The Administrator is not responsible for the investment decisions of the Partnership (all of which are made by the Management Company).  The Administrator does not provide any investment advisory or management services to the Partnership and therefore is not in any way responsible for the Partnership’s performance. The Administrator is not an auditor and does not provide any auditing services or assistance to the Partnership, nor is it a fiduciary to the Partnership, the General Partner, the Management Company or the Limited Partners.  The Administration Agreement does not create any contractual rights against or reliance on the Administrator by any person not a party thereto including, without limitation, any investor or counterparty appointed by the Partnership.  The Administrator is not responsible for monitoring any investment restrictions or compliance with the investment restrictions and therefore is not liable for any breach thereof.  Subject to certain limitations, under the Administration Agreement, the Partnership is obligated to indemnify and hold harmless the Administrator and the Administrator shall not be liable to the Partnership on account of anything done or omitted by the Administrator pursuant to the Administration Agreement.

      - The Administrator is not obligated to devote all or any specific portion of its time or business efforts to the affairs of the Partnership, and shall only devote the time, effort and skill as the Administrator determines in its sole discretion is necessary or appropriate to comply with its obligations under the Administration Agreement. The Administrator may engage in or possess any interest in other business ventures of any kind, nature or description, independently or with others, whether those ventures are competitive with the Partnership or otherwise. The Administrator serves as the administrator to other pooled investment vehicles. The Administrator may acquire or possess interests in the Partnership or other pooled investment vehicles administered by the Administrator. The Administrator may acquire or possess interests in the Portfolio Company and the interests may be of a different class or type, with different rights and preferences, than those held by the Partnership. The Administrator may acquire or possess interests in other companies or business ventures that are competitive with the Portfolio Company or the Partnership. Neither the Partnership nor any Partner will have the right, by virtue of this Agreement or otherwise, to share or participate in the other investments or activities of the Administrator or to the profits or income derived therefrom.

1.  #### SECTION: Partnership allocations.

   1. <u>Profit or Loss. </u>

         - Subject to, and after the application of, the allocation rules in <u>Section 6.2</u>, <u>Section 6.3</u>, and <u>Section 6.5</u>, Profits and Losses for a Fiscal Period shall be allocated among the Partners for such Fiscal Period so as to produce, as nearly as possible, an Adjusted Capital Account balance for each Partner (determined without regard to reductions for distributions made to the Partner during the Fiscal Period) equal to the following:
	
             - the sum of the cash and fair market value of property actually distributed to the Partner within such Fiscal Period, plus 
   
             - the hypothetical cash that would be distributed to such Partner if: (1) each of the Partnership’s assets were sold for an amount of hypothetical cash equal to the sum of (A) the Carrying Values of the assets at the end of such Fiscal Period, plus (B) the aggregate Partnership Minimum Gain and Partner Minimum Gain at the end of such Fiscal Period; (2) the Partnership paid all of its liabilities in accordance with their terms up to the amount of the hypothetical cash; and (3) the remaining hypothetical cash from such deemed sale were immediately distributed under <u>Section 4.2</u>; provided that any deduction attributable to the Management Fee shall be allocated to the Limited Partners based on the Management Fee allocable to each such Limited Partner.

         - Prior to an allocation of Profit being made pursuant to <u>Section 6.1(a)</u>, an amount of the Partnership’s gains from the sale of a Portfolio Investment, gains allocable to the Partners in connection with a distribution or other disposition of a Portfolio Investment and gains allocable in connection with a revaluation of a Portfolio Investment for any reason, in each case, which investment has been held by the Partnership for more than three years, shall be allocated one hundred percent (100%) to the GP Affiliated Persons whose Capital Contributions include a Cashless Portion pursuant to <u>Section 3.2(b)</u>, if any, until the cumulative amount allocated to such GP Affiliated Persons pursuant to this <u>Section 6.1(b)</u> in such Fiscal Period and all prior Fiscal Periods is equal to the aggregate amount of all Fee Adjustments.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such GP Affiliated Persons shall only receive an allocation pursuant to this <u>Section 6.1(b)</u> for a Fiscal Period to the extent that a gain (i) is realized after the date of the Fee Adjustment notice (made pursuant to <u>Section 3.2(b)</u>) to which it relates and (ii) is not attributable to unrealized appreciation inherent in the Partnership’s assets as of the date of the Fee Adjustment notice (made pursuant to <u>Section 3.2(b)</u>) to which it relates. 

         - For the avoidance of doubt, it is the intention of the Partners that, to the extent permitted by law, allocations made to the GP Affiliated Persons in respect of their Capital Contributions (disregarding for this purpose any Fee Adjustments) are intended to (i) be treated as “capital interest allocations” exempt from the provisions of Section 1061 of the Code (as described in Treasury Regulations Section 1.1061-3(c)(3) or any similar provision); (ii) be “separate and apart,” within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1061-3(c)(3)(ii)(B), from any allocations made to the General Partner in respect of its Carried Interest attributable to the other Partners; and (iii) meet the identification requirements of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1061-3(c)(3)(ii)(B).
			
   1. <u>Loss Limitation.</u> Notwithstanding the foregoing, no allocation of Loss shall be made to a Partner to the extent the allocation would cause such Partner to have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit (or increase any such Adjusted Capital Account Deficit). In the event that some but not all of the Partners would have or increase their Adjusted Capital Account Deficits as a consequence of such an allocation of Loss, the limitation set forth in this <u>Section 6.2</u> shall be applied on a Partner-by-Partner basis so as to allocate the maximum permissible Loss to each Partner under Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-l(b)(2)(ii)(d). In the event Loss is specially allocated to a Partner pursuant to the preceding sentence, an equal amount of Profit, respectively, shall be specially allocated to such Partner to offset such Loss prior to any allocation of Profit.

   1. <u>Regulatory Allocations.</u> The following special allocations of Profits and Losses (or items thereof) for purposes of maintaining Capital Accounts will be made to comply with the Treasury Regulations under Code Section 704(b).

      - Except as otherwise provided in Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(f), notwithstanding any other provision of this <u>Section 6</u>, if there is a net decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain during any Fiscal Period, each Partner shall be specially allocated items of income and gain for such Fiscal Period (and, if necessary, for subsequent Fiscal Periods) in an amount equal to such Partner’s share of the net decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(g). Allocations pursuant to the previous sentence shall be made in proportion to the respective amounts required to be allocated to each Partner pursuant to that sentence. The items to be so allocated shall be determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-2(f)(6) and 1.704-2(j)(2). This <u>Section 6.3(a)</u> is intended to comply with the minimum gain chargeback requirement of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(f) and shall be interpreted consistently with it and applied accordingly.

      - Except as otherwise provided in Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(4), notwithstanding any other provision of this <u>Section 6</u>, if there is a net decrease in Partner Minimum Gain during any Fiscal Period, each Partner who has a share of that Partner Minimum Gain, determined in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(5), shall be specifically allocated items of income and gain for such Fiscal Period (and, if necessary, for subsequent Fiscal Periods) in an amount equal to such Partner’s share of the net decrease in Partner Minimum Gain during such Fiscal Period determined pursuant to Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-2(i)(4) and 1.704-2(i)(5). Allocations pursuant to the previous sentence shall be made in proportion to the respective amounts required to be allocated to each Partner pursuant thereto. The items to be so allocated shall be determined in accordance with Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-2(i)(4) and 1.704-2(j)(2). This <u>Section 6.3(b)</u> is intended to comply with the partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain chargeback requirement of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(4) and shall be interpreted consistently with it and applied accordingly.

      - If any Partner unexpectedly receives any adjustments, allocations or distributions described in Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5) or (6) resulting in, or increasing, an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit for such Partner, items of Partnership income and gain shall be specially allocated to each such Partner in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate, to the extent required by the Treasury Regulations, the Adjusted Capital Account Deficit of such Partner as quickly as possible.  An allocation pursuant to this <u>Section 6.3(c)</u> shall be made only if and to the extent that any such Partner would have a deficit in its Adjusted Capital Account after all other allocations provided for in this <u>Section 6</u> have been tentatively made as if this <u>Section 6.3(c)</u> were not in this Agreement.

      - Nonrecourse Deductions for any Fiscal Period shall be allocated to the Partners in proportion to their Percentage Interests.

      - Any Partner Nonrecourse Deductions for any Fiscal Period shall be specially allocated to the Partner who bears the economic risk of loss with respect to the liability to which the Partner Nonrecourse Deduction is attributable in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i).

      - Items of income, gain, loss, and deductions shall be specifically allocated to the Partners to comply with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m).

      - The allocations of <u>Section 6.2</u> and Sections <u>(a)</u> through <u>(f)</u> of this <u>Section 6.3</u> (the “<u>Regulatory Allocations</u>”) are intended to comply with the requirements of Treasury Regulations issued pursuant to Code Section 704. Notwithstanding any provisions in this Agreement to the contrary, the Partnership shall take the Regulatory Allocations into account in allocating other Profit, Loss and items of income, gain, loss and deduction to the Partners so that, to the extent possible, the net amount of such allocations of Profit and Loss and other items shall be equal to the amount that would have been allocated to each Partner if the Regulatory Allocations had not occurred.

   1. <u>Tax Allocations.</u>

      - Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all items of Partnership income, gain, loss and deduction for income tax purposes shall be allocated among the Partners in the same manner as they share correlative items of Profit and Loss as computed for Capital Accounts for the relevant Fiscal Period.

      - In accordance with Code Section 704(c) and Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-3, income, gain, loss and deduction with respect to any property contributed to the capital of the Partnership where the Carrying Value differs from the tax basis of such property shall, solely for tax purposes, be allocated among the Partners so as to take account of any variation between the adjusted basis of such property to the Partnership for federal income tax purposes and its Carrying Value. The choice of allocation methods under Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-3 with respect to such revalued property shall be made by the General Partner.

      - If the Carrying Value of any item or part of or interest in a Portfolio Investment is adjusted pursuant to the definition of Carrying Value, subsequent allocations of income, gain, loss and deduction with respect to such Portfolio Investment shall take account of any variation between the adjusted basis of such Portfolio Investment for federal income tax purposes and its book value in the same manner as under Code Section 704(c). The choice of allocation methods under Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-3 with respect to such revalued Portfolio Investment shall be made by the General Partner.

      - In making any allocation among the Partners of income or gain from the sale or other disposition of a Partnership asset, the ordinary income portion, if any, of such income and gain resulting from the recapture of cost recovery or other deductions shall be allocated among those Partners who were previously allocated (or whose predecessors-in-interest were previously allocated) the cost recovery deductions or other deductions resulting in the recapture items, in proportion to the amount of such cost recovery deductions or other deductions previously allocated to them.

      - Allocations pursuant to this <u>Section 6.4</u> are solely for income tax purposes and shall not affect, or in any way be taken into account in computing, any Partner’s Capital Account or share of Profit, Losses or other items as computed for book purposes, or distributions pursuant to any provision of this Agreement.

   1. <u>Other Allocation Rules.</u>

      - If, during a Fiscal Period there is a permitted Transfer of Interest under this Agreement, then Profit, Loss, items of the foregoing, Taxable Income or Loss, and all other tax items of the Partnership for such Fiscal Period shall be divided and allocated among the Partners by taking into account their varying Interests during such Fiscal Period in accordance with Code Section 706(d) and using any conventions permitted by law and selected by the General Partner consistent with this Agreement.

      - If Partners are admitted to the Partnership pursuant to this Agreement on different dates, then Profit, Loss, items of the foregoing, Taxable Income or Loss, and all other tax items of the Partnership shall be allocated to the Partners during the relevant period in which Partners are so admitted using any convention permitted by Code Section 706 and selected by the General Partner.

   1. <u>Liability of Partners.</u> Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or the Act, no Partner shall be liable for the expenses, liabilities or obligations of the Partnership in excess of its Unfunded Commitment. A Partner other than the General Partner shall have no fiduciary duty to any other Partner, the Partnership or the General Partner.

   1. <u>No Obligation to Replenish Negative Capital Account.</u> Except as otherwise provided by law or expressly provided herein, no Partner shall have any obligation at any time to contribute any funds to replenish any negative balance in its Capital Account.

   1. <u>Exculpation.</u> To the fullest extent permitted by law, none of the GP Affiliated Persons, any members of the Advisory Committee (including any Limited Partner represented by a member of the Advisory Committee) nor any persons who previously served in such capacities (each, an “<u>Protected Person</u>”) shall be liable, in damages or otherwise, to any Limited Partner or the Partnership for (a) any action or omission with respect to the Partnership, provided that such persons did not (i) engage in conduct that constituted bad faith, fraud, gross negligence (as defined under the laws of the State of Delaware) or willful misconduct, or (ii) intentionally and materially (A) breach this Agreement or (B) violate applicable law; (b) any action or omission arising from reliance upon the opinion or advice as to legal matters of legal counsel or as to accounting matters of accountants, as long as such persons were selected and monitored with reasonable care or (c) the action or omission of any agent, contractor or consultant selected and monitored by any of them with reasonable care; provided that in the case of a Protected Person who is a member of the Advisory Committee (including any Limited Partner represented by a member of the Advisory Committee), such conduct was not taken by such Protected Person in bad faith. To the extent that, at law or in equity, the General Partner or any other Person has duties (including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to the Partnership or any Limited Partner, any such Person acting under this Agreement shall not be liable to the Partnership or any Limited Partner for its good faith reliance on the provisions of this Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement, to the extent they restrict or eliminate the duties and liabilities of the General Partner or any other Person otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the Partners to replace such other duties and liabilities of such Person to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. 

   1. <u>Indemnification.</u> To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Partnership will indemnify the Protected Persons, from and against any and all any claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses (including attorneys’ fees, judgments and expenses in connection therewith and amounts paid in defense and settlement thereof) to which any of such Persons may directly or indirectly become subject in connection with the Partnership or in connection with any involvement with a Portfolio Company, provided that such persons did not (i) engage in conduct that constituted bad faith, fraud, gross negligence (as defined under the laws of the State of Delaware) or willful misconduct, or (ii) intentionally and materially (A) breach this Agreement or (B) violate applicable law; provided, further, that in the case of a Protected Person who is a member of the Advisory Committee (including any Limited Partner represented by a member of the Advisory Committee), such conduct was not taken by such Protected Person in bad faith. The Partnership may in the discretion of the General Partner pay the expenses incurred by any Protected Person, as such expenses are incurred, in connection with any proceeding in advance of the final disposition, so long as the Partnership receives an undertaking by such Protected Person to repay the full amount advanced if there is a final determination that such Protected Person (i) engaged in conduct that constituted bad faith, fraud, gross negligence (as defined under the laws of the State of Delaware) or willful misconduct, (ii) intentionally and materially (A) breached this Agreement or (B) violated applicable law, or (iii) is not entitled to indemnification, as provided herein, for any other reason; provided that, without otherwise affecting the rights under this <u>Section 7.4</u> of a Protected Person to obtain indemnification in such actions, including advancement of expenses, no such advancement of expenses not otherwise covered by insurance shall be made to any GP Affiliated Person with respect to any derivative action against a GP Affiliated Person or a direct action against a GP Affiliated Person brought by at least 50% in interest of the Limited Partners. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such indemnity will be available with respect to any action (other than for indemnification) brought by a Protected Person against the Partnership or any action relating exclusively to an internal dispute among one or more GP Affiliated Persons. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that a Protected Person (i) engaged in conduct that constituted bad faith, fraud, gross negligence (as defined under the laws of the State of Delaware) or willful misconduct, or (ii) intentionally and materially (A) breached this Agreement or (B) violated applicable law. Any claims, actions and demands shall be satisfied first out of insurance policies, if any, maintained by the Partnership or, if applicable, any Parallel Fund, Alternative Investment Vehicle, feeder fund, co-investment vehicle or special purpose vehicle. The Partnership’s obligation, if any, to indemnify or advance expenses to any Person is intended to be secondary to any such obligation of, and shall be reduced by any amount such Person may collect as indemnification or advancement from, any Portfolio Company.

   1. <u>Non-Exclusivity.</u> The right of indemnification hereby provided shall not be exclusive of or affect any other rights to which any Person subject to indemnification hereunder may be entitled.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, commencing with the first fiscal quarter beginning on or after the sooner to occur of the end of the Investment Period or the date of the initial closing of a Permitted Successor Fund, the Base Rate shall be reduced by 10% of the Base Rate of the fiscal quarter prior to the stepdown (i.e., to 1.8%) and every 12 months thereafter, the Base Rate shall be reduced by 10% of the Base Rate prior to the stepdown. {% elif managementFee === 'TWOFIVEPERCENT' %} During the Term, but not during any extension(s) of the Term, the Partnership will pay the Management Company and/or one or more GP Affiliated Persons a management fee (the "Management Fee") with respect to each Limited Partner quarterly in advance at a rate equal to 2.5% per annum (the "Base Rate") of the Commitment of each Limited Partner. Notwithstanding the foregoing, commencing with the first fiscal quarter beginning on or after the sooner to occur of the end of the Investment Period or the date of the initial closing of a Permitted Successor Fund, the Base Rate shall be reduced by 10% of the Base Rate of the fiscal quarter prior to the stepdown (i.e., to 2.25%) and every 12 months thereafter, the Base Rate shall be reduced by 10% of the Base Rate prior to the stepdown.  {% elif managementFee === 'TWOAVERAGE' %} During the Term, but not during any extension(s) of the Term the Partnership will pay the Management Company and/or one or more GP Affiliated Persons a management fee (the "Management Fee") with respect to each Limited Partner quarterly in advance at a rate equal to 2.5% per annum (the "Base Rate") of the Commitment of each Limited Partner.

In the event the Offset Fees exceed the Management Fee payable for any given period, subsequent Management Fees shall be reduced by such excess amount until there has been a full reduction of the Management Fee by the Offset Fees. To the extent any such excess amount remains unapplied following the dissolution of the Partnership, the General Partner will pay each Limited Partner its proportionate share of such unapplied excess amount (unless such Limited Partner has previously notified the General Partner in writing of its irrevocable election not to receive its share of such excess), in which case such Limited Partner’s share shall be reallocated among the Limited Partners that do not provide such a notice *pro rata* in accordance with the Limited Partners’ Capital Contributions). 

      - Payment of the Management Fee may be deferred at the discretion of the General Partner. Any unpaid balance of the Management Fee will accrue as a liability of the Partnership as a Partnership Expense. Such accrued but deferred Management Fees will not accrue interest.

The GP Affiliated Person(s) that have made Commitment(s) to the Partnership shall not be charged a Management Fee.

      - The Management Fee otherwise payable by the Partnership to the Management Company and/or one or more GP Affiliated Persons pursuant to <u>Section 8.1(a)</u> for a quarterly period shall be offset by the amount of capital that one or more of such GP Affiliated Person(s) elected not to contribute in cash (pursuant to <u>Section 3.2(b))</u>, if any, with respect to the immediately preceding quarterly period (a “<u>Fee Adjustment</u>”). For the avoidance of doubt, such GP Affiliated Person(s), as of the date of this Agreement is irrevocably waiving a portion of the Management Fee that such GP Affiliated Person would otherwise be entitled to for the purpose of satisfying the Cashless Portion of its Capital Contribution obligation, as set forth in <u>Section 3.2(b)</u>. To the extent that the amount by which such GP Affiliated Person’s Cashless Portion, if any, during any given quarter exceeds its portion of the Management Fee otherwise payable for such quarter, such excess shall be carried forward for purposes of determining the Fee Adjustment to such GP Affiliated Person’s portion of the Management Fee for future periods; provided, that if any such excess amount remains following the dissolution of the Partnership, such GP Affiliated Persons’ shall pay their proportionate share of such excess amounts to the Limited Partners on a *pro rata* basis.

In the event the Placement Fees exceed the Management Fee payable for any given period, subsequent Management Fees shall be reduced by such excess amount until there has been a full reduction of the Management Fee by the Placement Fees. To the extent any such excess amount remains unapplied following the dissolution of the Partnership, the General Partner will pay each Limited Partner its proportionate share of such unapplied excess amount (unless such Limited Partner has previously notified the General Partner in writing of its irrevocable election not to receive its share of such excess).

   1. <u>Valuation.</u>

      - The General Partner will value the Partnership’s assets at their fair market value pursuant to this <u>Section 9</u>. 

      - The fair market value of Marketable Securities shall equal the average of their last sale prices on the securities exchange on which such Marketable Securities are traded on each trading day during the five-trading day period ending immediately prior to, and the five-trading day period immediately following, the date of valuation.  If the Marketable Securities are not traded on a securities exchange, but are actively traded over-the-counter, the fair market value of such Marketable Securities shall equal the average of their last bid price on each trading day during the five-trading day period ending immediately prior to, and the five-trading day period immediately following, the date of valuation.  
      
      - The fair market value of Digital Assets with a generally recognized exchange rate shall equal the average of their last sales prices on such exchange on each trading day during the five trading day period ending immediately prior to, and the five trading day period immediately following, the date of valuation.  The General Partner in its sole discretion may also value Digital Assets using coinmarketcap.com, exchanges that have the largest volume of Digital Asset trading at the time of valuation, or other Digital Asset pricing services or Digital Asset exchange data aggregators. 

      - With respect to the fair market value of the Partnership’s investments in Underlying Funds, the General Partner shall rely solely on the valuations provided to it by the general partners of the Underlying Funds unless the General Partner, in its discretion, determines that a valuation is either materially overstated or materially understated, in which case, the General Partner shall adjust the value such investment pursuant to <u>Section 9.1(f)</u>.
   
      - The fair market value of the securities of Portfolio Companies and/or Digital Assets that are not publicly traded will generally be the cost basis of such assets until there is persuasive evidence that a different fair market value can be determined from either an arm’s length transaction involving the acquired Portfolio Compan(ies) or Digital Asset(s) or other significant event, or in the opinion of the General Partner the book value and/or earnings have increased or decreased to such an extent that a higher or lower value than cost basis is justified. 

      - If the General Partner in good faith determines that, because of special circumstances, the valuation methods set forth in this <u>Section 9.1</u> do not fairly determine the value of an asset, the General Partner shall make such adjustments or use such alternative valuation method as it deems appropriate in its discretion.

      - The General Partner shall submit each fair market value determination of an asset made pursuant to <u>Section 9.1(e)</u> or <u>Section 9.1(f)</u> to the Advisory Committee or to a Majority in Interest of the Limited Partners. If, within 30 days of receipt of such valuation, the Advisory Committee or a Majority in Interest of the Limited Partners notifies the General Partner of an objection to such valuation, then, the valuation shall be determined by an independent securities expert selected by the General Partner and the Advisory Committee or Majority in Interest of the Limited Partners, whose determination shall be final and binding on all Partners. If the General Partner and the Advisory Committee or Majority in Interest of the Limited Partners cannot agree upon an independent securities expert, the Advisory Committee or Majority in Interest of the Limited Partners shall appoint one securities expert to render a valuation, the General Partner shall appoint one securities expert to render a valuation and the average of such securities experts’ valuations shall be adopted as the Partnership’s valuation of the asset.  Such determination shall be final and binding on all Partners. The fees and expenses of any securities expert or experts retained in accordance with this <u>Section 9.1(g)</u> shall be borne by the Partnership.

      - No value shall be placed on the goodwill or the name of the Partnership in determining the value of the interest of any Partner or in any accounting among the Partners.

   1. <u>Books and Records.</u> At all times during the Partnership’s continuance, it shall maintain, at its principal place of business (or at a place of business of any agent), copies of (a) separate books of account that shall show a true, fair and accurate record of all costs and expenses incurred, all charges made, all credits made and received, and all income derived in connection with the operation of the Partnership’s business and (b) the Partnership’s books regarding ownership of Interests, Commitments and Capital Contributions and a copy of this Agreement and of the Certificate of Limited Partnership. Each Limited Partner, on reasonable prior notice to the General Partner, shall have the right to examine the records of the Partnership to the extent permitted under Section 17-305(a) of the Act; provided that, to the maximum extent permitted under the Act, the General Partner shall have the right to impose such restrictions with respect to such examination as the General Partner, in its sole discretion, determines are appropriate under the circumstances. Each Limited Partner shall bear all expenses of such inspection and copying and shall keep all information obtained during such inspection confidential. The General Partner shall not be required, and each Limited Partner waives any right to require the General Partner, to account for the Partnership’s assets or operations.

The foregoing {%if fund.hasAudit === 'YES'%}audited{%endif%} annual financial statements and quarterly reports of the Partnership are dependent, in part, upon information to be provided to the General Partner by the Underlying Funds.  Accordingly, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this <u>Section 10.2</u>, the General Partner may furnish such annual financial statements and quarterly reports to the Limited Partners after the expiration of the time periods set forth above; provided the General Partner furnishes such annual financial statements and quarterly reports as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter following receipt of all financial information for each of the Underlying Funds necessary to prepare such annual financial statements and quarterly reports.

   1. <u>Partnership Representative.</u> The General Partner is hereby authorized to take the actions ultimately required to be designated as a “partnership representative” (or to designate an individual to act as partnership representative) for purposes of the Partnership Audit Provisions, and to take any and all actions that the “partnership representative” is authorized to take with respect to taxable years of the Partnership to which the Partnership Audit Provisions apply. The partnership representative shall use its reasonable efforts to apply the rules and elections under the Partnership Audit Provisions so that no Partner will bear any material tax as a result of any audit or proceeding that is attributable to another Partner (other than a predecessor in interest). The partnership representative is hereby authorized to take any action required or permitted (including, at the reasonable discretion of the partnership representative, making an election under Code Section 6226) to cause the financial burden of any “imputed underpayment” (as determined under Code Section 6225) and associated interest, adjustments to tax and penalties arising from a partnership-level adjustment that are imposed on the Partnership, and the cost of contesting any such partnership-level adjustment, to be borne by the Partners and former Partners to whom such imputed underpayment relates as determined by the partnership representative after consulting with the Partnership’s accountants or other advisers, taking into account any differences in the amount of taxes attributable to each Partner because of such Partner’s status. All Partners (and former Partners) agree to cooperate with, and to take all reasonable actions requested by the partnership representative and the Partnership, to avoid or reduce any tax imposed under Code Section 6225, including cooperating with any election under Code Section 6226, or to otherwise allow the Partnership and the partnership representative to comply with the Partnership Audit Provisions. In addition, each current and former Limited Partner shall furnish such information as may be requested by the General Partner, including such information as may be necessary to comply with an information request by an Underlying Fund, in connection with the Partnership Audit Provisions.  The obligations of a Partner under this <u>Section 10.3</u> shall survive a Partner’s sale or other disposition of its interests in the Partnership and the termination, dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the Partnership.

   1. <u>Confidentiality.</u>

      - Each Limited Partner shall keep confidential and shall not disclose without the prior consent of the General Partner any information, with respect to the Partnership, the General Partner, the Management Company, or an Affiliate of the foregoing, the Portfolio Investments or any prospective Portfolio Investments (“<u>Confidential Information</u>”); provided that a Limited Partner may disclose any Confidential Information (i) as has become generally available to the public other than as a result of the breach of this <u>Section 10.4</u> by such Limited Partner or any agent or Affiliate of such Limited Partner, (ii) to the extent necessary in order to comply with any law, order, regulation or ruling applicable to the Limited Partner, (iii) as may be required to be included in any report, statement or testimony required or requested to be submitted to any municipal, state or national regulatory body having jurisdiction over such Limited Partner and (iv) to its professional advisors, trustees and beneficiaries (“<u>Limited Partner Representatives</u>”), and the professional advisors, trustees and beneficiaries of such Limited Partner Representatives; provided that such Persons are advised of, and have agreed to be bound by, the confidentiality provisions herein, and the Limited Partner shall remain fully responsible and liable for any breach of this <u>Section 10.4</u> by any of its Limited Partner Representatives. To the fullest extent permitted by law, to the extent a Limited Partner seeks to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to clauses (ii) or (iii) hereunder, such Limited Partner shall provide the General Partner with prompt notification prior to the time of any such disclosure so the General Partner may seek an appropriate protective order or any other appropriate relief to prevent or withhold any such disclosure. Each Limited Partner who is subject to any “freedom of information” or similar law, rule or regulation that imposes upon such Limited Partner an obligation to make information available to the public, such Limited Partner shall request confidential treatment of the Confidential Information, and shall take such action as necessary for such Confidential Information to be exempt from disclosure, to the maximum extent permitted under such law, rule or regulation.

      - Each Limited Partner acknowledges and agrees that (i) the provisions of this <u>Section 10.4</u> are intended to protect the interests of the Partnership, the General Partner, the Management Company, the Portfolio Investments and the Limited Partners and (ii) the Confidential Information, including this Agreement, constitutes confidential proprietary information and trade secrets of the General Partner, the Management Company and the Partnership because such information is used routinely in connection with the business operations of the General Partner, the Management Company and the Partnership.

      - Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the General Partner shall have the right to keep confidential from any or all Limited Partners for such a period of time as the General Partner deems reasonable in its discretion (i) any information that the General Partner determines to be in the nature of trade secrets that should not be disclosed to the Limited Partners, and (ii) any other information (A) the disclosure of which the General Partner determines is not in the best interests of the Partnership or could damage the Partnership or any Portfolio Investment (including, for avoidance of doubt, a determination by the General Partner that disclosure of such Confidential Information to one or more Partners constitutes a disclosure risk with respect to such Confidential Information or that disclosure of such Confidential Information would  violate the provisions of <u>Section 5.2(c)</u>), or (B) that the Partnership is required by law or by agreement with a third Person to keep confidential.

1.  #### SECTION: TRANSFERS.

   1. <u>Transfer by General Partner.</u> The General Partner may assign, pledge, encumber or otherwise Transfer its interest in the Partnership, in whole or in part, to an Affiliate.

   1. <u>Transfer by Limited Partners.</u>

      - Subject to <u>Section 11.4</u>, a Limited Partner may not withdraw from the Partnership or assign or otherwise Transfer all or a portion of its Interest in the Partnership to one or more other Persons (each an “<u>Assignee</u>”) unless the General Partner provides its prior written consent (which may be withheld or granted in its sole discretion), provided that, in any event, each such Transfer shall be subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions unless waived by the General Partner:

         - the transferring Partner and the Assignee shall represent that (A) the proposed Transfer will not be effected on or through (1) a U.S. national, regional or local securities exchange, (2) a non-U.S. securities exchange or (3) an interdealer quotation system that regularly disseminates firm buy or sell quotations by identified brokers or dealers (including, without limitation, the NASDAQ System) and (B) it is not, and the proposed Transfer will not be made by, through or on behalf of (1) a Person, such as a broker or a dealer, making a market in Interests in the Partnership or (2) a Person who makes available to the public bid or offer quotes with respect to Interests in the Partnership;

         - such Transfer will not be effected on or through an “established securities market” or a “secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof,” as such terms are used in Treasury Regulations Section 1.7704-1;

         - such Transfer is exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and the registration or qualification requirements of state securities laws;
   
         - such assignment or Transfer would not cause the Partnership to become taxable as a corporation under the Code;
		
         - such assignment or Transfer would not result in a violation of applicable law, including the federal and state securities laws, or any term or condition of this Agreement;

         - such assignment or Transfer would not result in a requirement that the Partnership register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act;

         - such Transfer would not (by itself or taken together with other Transfers) cause the Partnership to be treated as a publicly traded partnership for purposes of Code Section 7704; and

         - at the discretion of the General Partner, in connection with any such Transfer for consideration the Assignee shall pay to the General Partner any unpaid Carried Interest attributable to the Interest to be Transferred based on the amount of such consideration and, solely for purposes of <u>Section 4.2(a)(i)</u>, the aggregate amount paid by the Assignee shall be treated as a Capital Contribution by the Assignee.


         For the avoidance of doubt, the General Partner shall be permitted to withhold its consent to any Transfer if it believes there is a reasonable risk that a proposed Transfer would not be consistent with the requirements of the preceding subsections.

      - Each Assignee shall have the right to become a Partner (a “<u>Substitute Partner</u>”) upon satisfaction of the following conditions:

         - the duly executed and acknowledged written instrument of assignment shall have been filed with the Partnership;

         - the transferring Partner and the Assignee shall have executed and acknowledged such other instruments and taken such other action as the General Partner shall reasonably deem necessary or desirable to effect such substitution, including, without limitation, the execution by the Assignee of a counterpart of or an appropriate supplement to this Agreement pursuant to which such Assignee agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions hereof;

         - the conditions set forth in this <u>Section 11.2</u> have been satisfied, and, if reasonably requested by the General Partner, the transferring Partner or the Assignee shall have obtained an opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the General Partner as to (A) such Transfer being exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and the registration or qualification requirements of state securities laws and (B) the matter referred to in clause (v) of <u>Section 11.2(a)</u>; such counsel may rely as to factual matters on a certificate of facts that will be provided to it by its client and by the General Partner;
      
         - the transferring Partner and/or the Assignee shall have paid to the Partnership such amount of money as is sufficient to cover all reasonable expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Partnership in connection with such substitution and/or Transfer; and

         - the General Partner shall have consented in writing to such substitution (which consent may be withheld or granted in the General Partner’s discretion).

      - No attempted Transfer or substitution shall be recognized by the Partnership and any purported Transfer or substitution shall be void unless effected in accordance with this Agreement.

   1. <u>Further Actions.</u> The General Partner or its successor shall cause this Agreement to be amended to reflect as appropriate the occurrence of any of the transactions referred to in <u>Section 11.2</u> as promptly as is practicable after such occurrence.

   1. <u>Death, Bankruptcy, Dissolution or Incapacity of a Limited Partner.</u> The death, Bankruptcy, dissolution or adjudicated incompetency of a Limited Partner shall not in and of itself cause a dissolution of the Partnership, but the rights of such Limited Partner to share in the Profits and Losses of the Partnership, to receive distributions and to assign its Interest in the Partnership pursuant to <u>Section 11.2(a)</u> or cause the substitution of a substituted Limited Partner pursuant to <u>Section 11.2(b)</u> shall, on the happening of such an event, devolve on its successor, executor, administrator, guardian, conservator or other legal representative for the purpose of settling its estate or administering its property, or in the event of the death of a Limited Partner whose Interest is held in joint tenancy, pass to the surviving joint tenant, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and the Partnership shall continue as a limited partnership. Such successor or personal representative, however, shall become a substituted Limited Partner only as provided in <u>Section 11.2(b)</u> with respect to an assignee of a Limited Partner’s Interest. The successor or estate of the Limited Partner shall be liable for all the obligations of the deceased, bankrupt, dissolved or incapacitated Limited Partner.

1.  #### SECTION: DURATION AND TERMINATION OF THE PARTNERSHIP.

   1. <u>Duration.</u> The Partnership commenced operations on the date of the filing of the Certificate of Limited Partnership pursuant to the Act and shall be perpetual, unless sooner dissolved, wound up and terminated in accordance with the provision of this Agreement or the Act. The Partnership shall be dissolved upon the first to occur of any of the following events:

      - Ten years after the Initial Closing (the “<u>Term</u>”), provided, that the Term may be extended by the General Partner, in its sole discretion, for up to two additional one-year periods, provided, further, that upon the conclusion of such extensions of the Term, the General Partner may further extend the Term for additional one-year periods with the prior consent of the Advisory Committee or a Majority in Interest of the Limited Partners;

      - Upon the election of the General Partner and the consent by a Majority in Interest of the Limited Partners to liquidate the Partnership assets and wind up the affairs of the Partnership; or

      - Any winding up and dissolution required by this Agreement or the operation of law.

   1. <u>Liquidation.</u> Upon the dissolution of the Partnership, the General Partner (or, if there is no general partner, a Person who may be approved by the Advisory  Committee or a Majority in Interest of the Limited Partners shall act as liquidator to wind up the Partnership) shall have full power and authority to sell or assign any or all of the Partnership’s assets and to wind up the Partnership and liquidate its assets in an orderly and businesslike manner. All proceeds from liquidation shall first be applied in payment of expenses properly incurred in the winding up, including the remuneration of the liquidator, following which the proceeds shall be distributed in the following order of priority: (a) to creditors, including Partners who are creditors, to the extent otherwise permitted by law, in satisfaction or provision for payment of liabilities of the Partnership, including any contingent liabilities of the Partnership (whether by payment or establishment of reasonable reserves in accordance with the terms of this Agreement) other than liabilities for distributions to Partners on account of their respective Interests in the Partnership and (b) to the Partners in accordance with <u>Section 4.2</u>. A reasonable time shall be allowed for the winding up of the affairs of the Partnership in order to minimize any losses that might otherwise result. The General Partner shall use commercially reasonable efforts to carry out the liquidation in conformity with the timing requirements of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-l(b)(2)(ii)(g), but will not be bound to do so or liable in any way to any Partner for failure to do so.
   
   1. <u>Final Distribution.</u> Subject to <u>Section 12.2</u>, the General Partner shall use commercially reasonable efforts to liquidate the Partnership’s assets and distribute cash to the Partners. If the General Partner shall determine, because the distribution of cash would not be in the best interests of the Partnership or would be impracticable, that a portion of the Partnership’s assets should be distributed in kind to the Partners in accordance with <u>Section 4.5</u> and such assets’ fair market value shall be determined in accordance with <u>Section 9.1</u>. Any unrealized appreciation or depreciation with respect to such assets shall be allocated among the Partners in accordance with <u>Section 6</u>, and distribution of any such assets in kind to a Partner shall be considered a distribution of an amount equal to the assets’ fair market value for purposes of <u>Section 12.2</u>.


   1. <u>Termination.</u> Upon the completion of the winding up of Partnership assets as provided in <u>Section 12.2</u> and <u>Section 12.3</u>, the legal existence of the Partnership shall be terminated by the filing of a Certificate of Cancellation of the Certificate of Limited Partnership by the Person acting as liquidator.


1.  #### SECTION: MISCELLANEOUS.

   1. <u>Amendment.</u> Except as provided in the immediately succeeding sentence or <u>Section 13.2</u>, this Agreement may be modified or amended only upon execution by the General Partner and a Majority in Interest of the Limited Partners of a written amendment to this Agreement or of a written amended and restated Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this <u>Section 13.1</u>, the General Partner shall have the authority to amend or modify this Agreement without any vote or other action by the other Partners: (a) to satisfy any requirements, conditions, guidelines, directives, orders, rulings or regulations of any governmental authority, or as otherwise required by applicable law; (b) subject to <u>Section 11.3</u>, to reflect the admission of substitute, additional or successor Partners and Transfers of Interests pursuant to this Agreement; (c) to qualify or continue the Partnership as a limited partnership in all jurisdictions in which the Partnership conducts or plans to conduct business; (d) to change the name of the Partnership; (e) in accordance with <u>Section 3.1</u>, <u>Section 3.2(b)</u>, <u>Section 3.6</u>, <u>Section 5.12<u> or </u>Section 8.1(e)</u>; (f) to cure any ambiguity or correct or supplement any provisions herein contained that may be incomplete or inconsistent with any other provision herein contained or to correct any typographical errors contained herein, or (g) to make any other changes that the General Partner determines in good faith do not materially and adversely affect the rights and obligations, taken as a whole, of any existing Limited Partners. No amendment that adversely affects a Limited Partner disproportionately relative to the Limited Partners generally shall become effective without the consent of such Limited Partner.  

   1. <u>Tax Related Amendments.</u> Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, if after the Initial Closing, any statute, rule or regulation is enacted or promulgated (or if the General Partner determines that such enactment or promulgation is imminent) or the U.S. Internal Revenue Service issues any notice or announcement that affects the U.S. federal income tax treatment of any allocations or distributions related to the General Partner’s Carried Interest or Commitment, then the General Partner may amend this Agreement in any manner, without the consent of any Limited Partner, including without limitation by dividing the General Partner into two or more separate entities; provided, however, that (a) the General Partner shall not be permitted to amend this Agreement pursuant to this <u>Section 13.2</u> in any manner that would adversely affect any Limited Partner’s economic interest in the Partnership (without the prior written consent of such Limited Partner), and (b) the General Partner shall bear any costs or expenses incurred by the Partnership in connection with any amendments that are made pursuant to this <u>Section 13.2</u>.

   1. <u>Actions and Power of Attorney.</u>

      - Each Partner shall execute and deliver such other certificates, agreements and documents, and take such other actions, as may be required by law or, upon advice of counsel to the General Partner, advisable and, in such case, requested by the General Partner in connection with the formation of the Partnership and the achievement of its purposes, including, without limitation, (i) any documents that the General Partner deems necessary or appropriate to form, qualify or continue the Partnership as a limited partnership in all jurisdictions in which the Partnership conducts or plans to conduct business and (ii) all such agreements, certificates, tax statements and other documents as may be required to be filed in respect of the Partnership.

      - Each Partner hereby constitutes and appoints the General Partner, with full power of substitution, the true and lawful attorney-in-fact and agent of such Partner, to execute, acknowledge, verify, swear to, deliver, record and file, in its or its Assignee’s name, place and stead, all in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, all instruments, documents and certificates that may from time to time be required by the laws of the United States of America, the State of Delaware, any other jurisdiction in which the Partnership conducts or plans to conduct its affairs or any political subdivision or agency thereof to effectuate, implement and continue the valid existence and affairs of the Partnership, including the power and authority to verify, swear to, acknowledge, deliver, record and file:

         - all certificates and other instruments, including any amendments to this Agreement or the Certificate of Limited Partnership, which the General Partner deems appropriate to form, qualify or continue the Partnership as a limited partnership (or a company in which the members have limited liability) in the State of Delaware and all other jurisdictions in which the Partnership conducts or plans to conduct its affairs;

         - any amendments to this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument which the General Partner deems appropriate to (A) effect the addition, substitution or removal of any Partner or General Partner pursuant to this Agreement, or (B) effect any other amendment or modification to this Agreement, but only if such amendment or modification is duly adopted in accordance with the terms hereof;

         - all conveyances and other instruments which the General Partner deems appropriate to reflect the dissolution and termination of the Partnership pursuant to the terms hereof, including the writing required by the Act to cancel the Certificate of Limited Partnership; and

         - certificates of assumed name and such other certificates and instruments as may be necessary under the fictitious or assumed name statutes from time to time in effect in the State of Delaware and all other jurisdictions in which the Partnership conducts or plans to conduct its affairs.

      - The power of attorney granted herein shall be deemed to be coupled with an interest, shall survive and not be affected by the dissolution, bankruptcy or legal disability of the Partner, and shall extend to such Partner’s successors and assigns. Any Person dealing with the Partnership may conclusively presume and rely upon the fact that any instrument referred to above, executed by such attorney-in-fact and agent, is authorized, regular and binding, without further inquiry. If required, the Partner shall execute and deliver to the General Partner within five days after the receipt of a request therefor, such further designations, powers of attorney or other instruments as the General Partner shall reasonably deem necessary for the purposes hereof. The foregoing power-of-attorney may be exercised by the General Partner either by signing separately as attorney-in-fact for a Partner or, after listing the names of all the Partners, by a single signature of the General Partner acting as attorney-in-fact for all of them.


   1. <u>Side Letters.</u> Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement or of any Subscription Agreement, it is hereby acknowledged and agreed that the General Partner, on behalf of the Partnership, without the approval of any Limited Partner or any other Person, may enter into a separate side letter or similar agreement to or with a Limited Partner or prospective Limited Partner that has the effect of establishing rights under, or waiving or varying certain terms of, this Agreement, or allowing such investors to invest on different terms than those specifically described in this Agreement, including, without limitation, terms relating to fees, including the Management Fee and Carried Interest, or depth of information provided to such investors concerning the Partnership. The General Partner also may grant limited liquidity rights with respect to a Limited Partner as may be warranted by investor-specific legal or regulatory requirements. The parties hereto agree that any terms contained in a separate side letter or similar agreement to or with a Limited Partner or prospective Limited Partner shall govern with respect to such Limited Partner or prospective Limited Partner notwithstanding the provisions of this Agreement and/or of any Subscription Agreement. 


   1. <u>No Third Party Beneficiaries.</u>  Except with respect to the Partnership’s obligations to Protected Persons under <u>Section 7.3</u> and <u>Section 7.4</u>, the rights of a lender in connection with a capital call line of credit or credit facility established by the Partnership as permitted under <u>Section 3.8</u>, and/or as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement are not for the benefit of, or enforceable by, any third party and shall not give rise to any rights with respect to any third party.


   1. <u>Prohibited Partner Investment; Withdrawals. </u>

      - Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if, following a Partner’s investment in the Partnership, it is discovered that the investment contravenes U.S. federal, state or other laws or regulations, including anti-money laundering laws (a “<u>Prohibited Partner Investment</u>”) or has become a Prohibited Partner Investment, such investment may immediately be withdrawn by the Partnership or otherwise be subject to the remedies required by law, and the Partner shall have no claim against the Partnership, the General Partner or any of its Affiliates for any form of damages as a result of such forced withdrawal or other action. Upon the written request from the Partnership, the Partner agrees to provide all information reasonably requested by the Partnership to enable the Partnership to comply with all applicable anti-money-laundering statutes, rules, regulations and policies, including any policies applicable to the Portfolio Companies held or proposed to be held by the Partnership. Each Partner understands and agrees that the Partnership may release confidential information about the Partner and, if applicable, any Affiliates to any Person, if the General Partner determines that it is necessary in light of relevant rules and regulations concerning Prohibited Partner Investments, provided that the General Partner shall promptly notify the Partner if such confidential information is released unless such notification is prohibited by law.

      - In the event a withdrawal is required under <u>Sections 3.9</u> or <u>13.6(a)</u>, the withdrawing Limited Partner shall be entitled to receive as soon as reasonably practicable after the effective date of such withdrawal an amount equal to the fair market value of such Limited Partner’s Interest as of the effective date of the withdrawal (calculated by treating all Partnership assets as though sold at fair market value). The fair market value of such Limited Partner’s Interest shall be determined in accordance with <u>Section 9.1</u> with any unrealized appreciation or depreciation allocated in accordance with <u>Section 6</u>. Any distribution or payment to a withdrawing Limited Partner pursuant to this <u>Section 13.6(b)</u> may, in the sole discretion of the General Partner, be made in cash, in kind or in the form of a promissory note bearing interest at the rate of interest per annum equal to the Prime Rate and having all of the principal thereof and interest thereon payable upon liquidation of the Partnership, or any combination thereof. No approval of the Advisory Committee or of the other Limited Partners shall be required prior to the making of such distribution.


   1. <u>UBTI; ECI.</u>  The General Partner shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize (a) the amount of UBTI recognized by a Tax Exempt Partner as a result of its investment in the Partnership and (b) the amount of ECI recognized by any Non-U.S. Partner as a result of its investment in the Partnership; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to (i) any UBTI attributable to indebtedness and guarantees permitted under <u>Section 3.8</u>, (ii) any UBTI or ECI attributable to any fees paid to a GP Affiliated Person that offset the Management Fee, or (iii) any UBTI or ECI attributable to direct or indirect (e.g., through an entity established to facilitate the investment into Digital Assets) investment by the Partnership in Digital Assets, if any.  The Limited Partners acknowledge that the General Partner may use Alternative Investment Vehicles to structure Portfolio Investments in order to comply with the obligations of this <u>Section 13.7</u>, and the General Partner shall be deemed to satisfy its commercially reasonable efforts undertaking in this <u>Section 13.7</u> with respect to a Portfolio Investment if it provides such an Alternative Investment Vehicle for such Portfolio Investment.

   1. <u>Jurisdiction.</u>

      - To the fullest extent permitted by law, by executing this Agreement, each Partner hereby agrees that any claim, dispute, or controversy of whatever nature arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including, without limitation, any action or claim based on tort, contract, or statute (including any claims of breach), or concerning the interpretation, effect, termination, validity, performance and/or breach of this Agreement (“<u>Claim</u>”), shall be resolved by final and binding arbitration (“<u>Arbitration</u>”) before a single arbitration panel of three arbitrators (“<u>Arbitrators</u>”) selected from and administered by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service (“<u>JAMS</u>”) in accordance with its then existing rules for commercial arbitration. Each party shall select one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators so selected shall choose a third arbitrator. The Arbitration shall be held in {$ARBITRATION_CITY}, {$ARBITRATION_STATE}.

      - Depositions may be taken and full discovery may be obtained in any Arbitration commenced under this provision. The Arbitrators shall, within 15 days after the conclusion of the Arbitration hearing, issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The Arbitrators shall be authorized to award compensatory damages, but shall not be authorized (i) to award non-economic damages, (ii) to award punitive damages, or (iii) to reform, modify or materially change this Agreement or any other agreements contemplated hereunder; provided that the damage limitations described in parts (i) and (ii) of this sentence will not apply if such damages are statutorily imposed. The Arbitrators also shall be authorized to grant any temporary, preliminary or permanent equitable remedy or relief they deem just and equitable and within the scope of this Agreement, including, without limitation, an injunction or order for specific performance.

      - Each party shall bear its own attorney’s fees, costs, and disbursements arising out of the Arbitration, and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the Arbitration; provided that the Arbitrators shall be authorized to determine whether a party is substantially the prevailing party, and if so, to award to that substantially prevailing party reimbursement for its reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and disbursements (including, for example, expert witness fees and expenses, photocopy charges, travel expenses, etc.), and/or the fees and costs of the Arbitration.
   
      - Any judgment or award rendered by JAMS will be final, binding and non- appealable, and judgment may be entered by any state or federal court having jurisdiction thereof. Each Partner expressly acknowledges that, pursuant to this <u>Section 13.8</u>, it is waiving certain rights and protections which may otherwise be available if a Claim between the parties were determined by litigation in court, including, without limitation, the right to seek or obtain certain types of damages precluded by this <u>Section 13.8</u>, the right to a jury trial, certain rights of appeal, and a right to invoke formal rules of procedure and evidence.

   1.  <u>Governing Law.</u> This Agreement and the rights of the parties hereunder shall be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, and all rights and remedies shall be governed by such laws, without regard to principles of conflicts of laws, except to the extent such laws are preempted by applicable U.S. federal law.


   1. <u>Notices.</u> Any notice or demand required or permitted to be given or made to or upon any party hereto pursuant to any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been duly given or made for all purposes if (a) in writing and delivered by hand, overnight express courier service against receipt, or by registered or certified mail, or (b) sent by email, to such party at the address set forth in the books and records of the Partnership, or such other address as any party hereto may at any time, or from time to time, direct by notice given to the other party in accordance with this <u>Section 13.10</u>. The General Partner shall amend the books and records of the Partnership from time to time to reflect any such change. Any notice complying with the foregoing shall be deemed to have been given, (i) when delivered personally, (ii) on the next Business Day after being sent by a recognized overnight courier service, (iii) on the third day after being sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt request, and (iv) upon being sent by email transmission during normal business hours or on the following Business Day.


   1. <u>Force Majeure.</u> Whenever any act or thing is required of the Principal(s), the Partnership, the General Partner, the Management Company or the Administrator hereunder to be done within any specified period of time, the Principal(s), the Partnership, the General Partner, the Management Company or the Administrator, as the case may be, shall be entitled to such additional period of time to do such act or thing as shall equal any period of delay resulting from causes beyond the reasonable control of the Principal(s), the Partnership, the General Partner, the Management Company or the Administrator, as the case may be; provided that this provision shall not have the effect of permanently relieving the Principal(s), the Partnership, the General Partner, the Management Company or the Administrator from the obligation to perform any such act or thing.   

   1. <u>Further Assurances.</u> Each Limited Partner hereby covenants and agrees on behalf of itself and its successors and assigns, without further consideration, to prepare, execute, acknowledge, file, record, publish and deliver such other information, instruments, documents, tax forms and statements and to take such other actions as may be reasonably requested by the General Partner in order to effectively carry out the purposes of the Partnership and this Agreement.  By executing this Agreement, each Limited Partner waives any provision under the laws and regulations of any jurisdiction that would, in the absence of such waiver, prevent or inhibit the Partnership’s compliance with applicable law as described in this paragraph including, but not limited to preventing (i) the Limited Partner from providing any requested information or documentation, or (ii) the disclosure by the General Partner or its agents of the provided information or documentation to applicable governmental or regulatory authorities.

   1. <u>Waiver of Partition and Accounting.</u> Except as may be otherwise required by law, each Limited Partner hereby irrevocably waives any and all rights that it may have to maintain an action for an accounting or for partition or any similar action of any of the Partnership’s property.

   1. <u>Interpretation.</u> Wherever from the context it appears appropriate, each term stated in either the singular or the plural shall include the singular and the plural, and pronouns stated in either the masculine or the neuter gender shall include the masculine, the feminine and the neuter. The words “include,” “includes” and “including” shall be deemed to be followed by the phrase “without limitation” to the extent such words are not already so qualified. This Agreement shall not be construed against any party by reason of that party having caused this Agreement to be drafted. To the fullest extent permitted by law and notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or in any agreement contemplated herein or applicable provisions or law or equity or otherwise, whenever in this Agreement a Person is permitted or required to make a decision in its “good faith” or under another express standard, such Person shall act under such express standard and shall not be subject to any other or different standards.

   1. <u>Headings; Internal References.</u> When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, such reference shall be to a Section to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience and reference purposes only and shall not be deemed to alter or affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of any provisions of this Agreement. The words “hereof,” “herein” and “hereunder” and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.

   1. <u>Entire Agreement.</u> This Agreement, together with each Limited Partner’s Subscription Agreement and each side letter or similar agreement entered into pursuant to <u>Section 13.4</u>, contains the entire agreement among the respective parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior arrangements or understandings with respect thereto.    


   1. <u>Severability.</u> Any provision hereof that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. There shall be substituted for such provision so rendered ineffective a provision that, as far as legally possible, most nearly reflects the intent of the parties hereto.


   1. <u>Digital Signatures.</u> To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, any vote, consent, approval, waiver, agreement, amendment or other document or instrument that is permitted or required to be signed, executed or otherwise affirmed by a Person pursuant to or otherwise in connection with this Agreement may be signed, executed or otherwise affirmed in digital form (e.g., via e-mail or third party digital signing service) and no physical signature shall be required.

   1. <u>Non-Waiver.</u> No waiver of the provisions hereof shall be valid unless in writing and signed by the party to be bound and then only to the extent therein set forth.  Except as specifically herein provided, no failure or delay by any party in exercising any right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, and a waiver of a particular right or remedy on one occasion shall not be deemed a waiver of any other right or remedy or a waiver on any subsequent occasion.

   1. <u>Counterparts.</u> This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument.
