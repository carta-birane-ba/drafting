  ## ADVISOR LETTER AGREEMENT
</center>

This Advisor Letter Agreement (this <u>“Agreement”</u>) is effective as of the date set forth on the signature page by and between {{fund.generalPartnerName}} (the <u>“Company”</u>), the general partner of {{ fund.name }} (the <u>“Fund”</u>), and the undersigned advisor (the <u>“Advisor”</u>).


The parties agree as follows:

1. <u>**Services**</u>. Advisor agrees to act as an advisor to the Company and provide advice and assistance to the Company as mutually agreed to by the parties and as may be more specifically described on the signature page hereto (collectively, the "<u>Services</u>").

1. <u>**Compensation**.</u> For the provision of the Services, Advisor shall be entitled to receive the compensation as detailed on the signature page hereto. 

1. <u>**Term and Termination**.</u> The term of this Agreement shall continue until terminated by either party for any reason upon thirty (30) days prior written notice without further obligation or liability except for the compensation, if any, earned by Advisor through such date of termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner may terminate this Agreement immediately for Cause.  For purposes of this Agreement, <u>“Cause”</u> shall mean a determination by the General Partner that Advisor (i) engaged in conduct that constituted willful misconduct, fraud, bad faith, gross negligence or a material violation of applicable law or (ii) materially breached the General Partner’s Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement (as amended and/or restated, the <u>“Operating Agreement”</u>) and/or this Agreement and such breach continued for a period of thirty (30) days after receipt by Advisor of written notice thereof from the General Partner specifying such breach and requesting that the same be remedied to the General Partner’s reasonable satisfaction within such thirty (30)-day period.

1. <u>**Independent Contractor**.</u> Advisor’s relationship with the Company will be that of an independent contractor and not that of an employee. Advisor will not be eligible for any employee benefits, nor will the Company make deductions from payments made to Advisor for employment or income taxes, all of which will be Advisor’s responsibility. Advisor will have no authority to enter into contracts that bind the Company or create obligations on the part of the Company without the prior written authorization of the Company. 

1. <u>**Nondisclosure of Confidential Information**.</u>
   - <u>**Agreement Not to Disclose**.</u> Advisor agrees not to use any Confidential Information (as defined below) disclosed to Advisor by the Company or its affiliate(s) (collectively, “{{ fund.name }} Person”), whether before or after the Effective Date (as defined below), for Advisor’s own use or for any purpose other than to carry out discussions concerning, and the undertaking of, the Services. Advisor agrees to take all reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure or use of Confidential Information of the {{ fund.name }} Persons in order to prevent it from falling into the public domain or the possession of persons other than agents of the {{ fund.name }} Persons or persons to whom the Company consents to such disclosure. Upon request by the Company, any materials or documents that have been furnished by any of the {{ fund.name }} Persons to Advisor in connection with the Services shall be promptly returned by Advisor to the Company.  Advisor’s obligation under this paragraph 5 shall continue during the term of the Agreement and end on the second anniversary of the end of the term of this Agreement.
   -  <u>**Definition of Confidential Information**.</u> “Confidential Information” means any information, technical data or know-how (whether disclosed before or after the date of this Agreement), including, but not limited to, information relating to business and product or service plans, financial projections, customer lists, business forecasts, sales and merchandising, human resources, patents, patent applications, computer object or source code, research, inventions, processes, designs, drawings, engineering, marketing or finance to be confidential or proprietary or which information would, under the circumstances, appear to a reasonable person to be confidential or proprietary. Confidential Information does not include information, technical data or know-how that: (i) is in the possession of Advisor at the time of disclosure, as shown by Advisor’s files and records immediately prior to the time of disclosure; or (ii) becomes part of the public knowledge or literature, not as a direct or indirect result of any improper inaction or action of Advisor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Advisor may disclose Confidential Information with the prior written approval of the applicable {{ fund.name }}Person or pursuant to the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency or other governmental body. 

1. <u>**No Rights Granted**.</u> Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any rights under any patent, copyright or other intellectual property right of a {{ fund.name }} Person, nor shall this Agreement grant Advisor any rights in or to a {{ fund.name }} Person’s Confidential Information, except the limited right to use the Confidential Information in connection with the Services. 

1. <u>**Assignment of Intellectual Property**.</u> To the extent that Advisor jointly or solely conceives, develops or reduces to practice any new inventions, original works of authorship, developments, concepts, know-how, improvements or trade secrets, whether or not patentable or registrable under copyright or similar laws or other intellectual property which would be deemed to be Confidential Information of a {{ fund.name }} Person (collectively, <u>“Intellectual Property”</u>) which clearly relates to the {{ fund.name }} Person’s business or technology and has been created by Advisor in the course of the performance of Services, Advisor hereby acknowledges that it is “work made for hire” for the benefit of the {{ fund.name }} Person and hereby assigns all rights, titles and interest to such Intellectual Property to the {{ fund.name }} Person. 

1. <u>**Duty to Assist**.</u> As reasonably requested by the Company and only with respect to Intellectual Property created by Advisor for a {{ fund.name }} Person as provided in paragraph 7 above, Advisor shall take all steps reasonably necessary to assist the {{ fund.name }} Person in obtaining and enforcing in its own name any such Intellectual Property right. Advisor’s obligation to assist the {{ fund.name }} Person shall continue beyond the termination of this Agreement. 

1. <u>**The Company’s Right to Disclose**.</u> During the term of this Agreement, the Company shall have the right to disclose the existence of this Agreement, Advisor’s status as an Advisor, and to include Advisor’s name, image and profile in various promotional materials, including, but not limited to, any private placement memorandum or other offering materials, executive summaries and the Company’s or its affiliate’s world wide web page.

1. <u>**No Conflicts; Compliance with Law**.</u> Advisor represents that Advisor’s compliance with the terms of this Agreement and provision of Services hereunder will not violate any duty which Advisor may have to any other person or entity (such as a present or former employer), and Advisor agrees that Advisor will not do anything in the performance of Services hereunder that would violate any such duty. In addition, Advisor agrees that, during the term of this Agreement, Advisor shall promptly notify the Company in writing of any competitor of the Company, which Advisor is also performing services. It is understood that in such event, the Company will review whether Advisor’s activities are consistent with Advisor remaining as an advisor of the Company.  In providing the Services to the Company, the Advisor agrees to comply with all applicable laws and regulations (including, without limitation, United States federal and state securities laws, the rules and regulations of the Securities Exchange Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority).

1. <u>**Miscellaneous**.</u> Any term of this Agreement may be amended or waived only with the written consent of the parties. This Agreement, including the signature page (and its exhibit and the agreements referred to therein), constitute the sole agreement of the parties and supersedes all oral negotiations and prior writings with respect to the subject matter hereof. The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction listed on the signature page, without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.

**Effective Date**:  {{now | date('MMMM DD, YYYY') }}

**Governing Law**: State of Delaware (without giving effect to conflict of law principles)

**Advisor Services**:
- Promoting the objectives and goals of {{ fund.generalPartnerName }} (the <u>“Company”</u>) through networking and otherwise.
-  Advising the managers, officers and other representatives of the Company or its affiliates or the portfolio companies of {{ fund.name }} (the <u>“Fund”</u>), upon request, at reasonable times and subject to Advisor interest and availability.  
-  Providing assistance and advice to the Company or its affiliates regarding strategic, financing and fundraising opportunities relating to Fund.
-  Making introductions to entrepreneurs and founders in personal and professional network regarding potential portfolio investments.

**Advisor Equity Compensation**:

- In exchange for performing the Services, Advisor shall be admitted to the Company as a member of the Company.  In order to become a member of the Company, Advisor shall execute, and be subject to the terms and conditions of, the Company’s Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement (as amended and/or restated, the <u>“Operating Agreement”</u>).  Advisor shall not be required to contribute any capital to the Company.  Capitalized terms not defined in this Agreement shall have the meaning given in the Operating Agreement.

- Advisor shall receive a profits interest in the Company (<u>“Interest”</u>), which would entitle Advisor to a distribution from the Company based on Advisor’s Carried Interest Percentage of the Carried Interest proceeds received by the Company, net of any Company Expenses and/or financial obligations of the Company (<u>“Carried Interest Distribution”</u>).  

-  Advisor’s Interest shall vest over a [four]-year period with a [one]-year cliff.  If fully vested, Advisor’s Carried Interest Percentage with respect to Advisor’s Interest shall equal [1.00]%.  Advisor’s Carried Interest Percentage may not be diluted or otherwise reduced by the Manager(s) without Advisor’s prior written consent.  

-  Advisor’s Interest will vest by [25]% on the first business day following the end of the [12]-month period commencing as the Effective Date and on the first business day following the end of each of the next [three] 12-month periods (each, a <u>“Vesting Date”</u>).  The vesting schedule with respect to Advisor’s Interest is set forth on <u>Exhibit A</u>.  The Manager(s) will update Exhibit E of the Operating Agreement and <u>Exhibit A</u> of this Agreement on or about each Vesting Date. 

-  Notwithstanding paragraph d, the vesting of the Interest will cease as of the date on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 3 of this Agreement (the <u>“End Date”</u>) and will be prorated if the End Date occurs other than on a Vesting Date based on the number of days between the last Vesting Date and the End Date relative to the number of days between the last Vesting Date and the next Vesting Date. As of the End Date, the unvested portion of Advisor’s Interest will be forfeited.  After the End Date, Advisor may remain a member of the Company and keep Advisor’s vested Interest, subject to the terms and conditions of the Operating Agreement.

-  Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in the Operating Agreement, if a distribution of Carried Interest proceeds, pursuant to Section 7.2(a) of the Operating Agreement, occurs prior to the date on which Advisor’s Interest becomes fully vested, Advisor’s share of such distribution shall be determined as though Advisor was fully vested as of the date of such distribution, provided that Advisor’s Interest is at least [25]% vested (i.e., Adviser has provided services under this Agreement for at least 12 months commencing as of the Effective Date), <u>provided</u>, <u>further</u> that if the End Date occurs prior to the date on which Advisor’s Interest becomes fully vested, then the amount(s) of any distribution(s) made to Advisor that exceed the amount(s) of any distribution(s) that would have been made if such distribution(s) were made based solely on the vested portion of the Interest (the <u>“Excess Distributions”</u>) shall, in the sole discretion of the Manager(s), (i) be promptly paid to the Company by Advisor and/or (ii) be repaid by reducing the amount of the next succeeding distribution(s) which would otherwise have been made to Advisor.    

-  Becoming a Member shall only entitle Advisor to the Carried Interest Distribution.  Except as otherwise agreed to in writing by the Manager(s), Advisor shall not be entitled to any other proceeds, profits, income or revenue received by the Company or any other economic right related to the Company.  Advisor shall be a passive member of the Company and will only have limited voting rights as a member of the Company. 

-  Each Carried Interest Distribution shall occur, in whole or in part, at such time(s) and in such amount(s), as determined in the sole discretion of the Manager(s).  There is no guarantee that Advisor will receive a Carried Interest Distribution, or the full amount of a Carried Interest Distribution, as the Company may not receive any carried interest proceeds or sufficient carried interest proceeds to pay the full amount of a Carried Interest Distribution.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Fund will distribute carried interest to the Company using a “European Waterfall,” which means that the Company will not receive any carried interest proceeds until the Fund’s investors have received a return of their investment in the Fund (i.e., the Company will not likely receive any Carried Interest proceeds until latter part of the Fund’s term).     

-  The Company may withhold a portion of the Carried Interest Distribution otherwise payable to Advisor in order to satisfy the Company’s clawback obligations, if any, under the Fund’s limited partnership agreement (the <u>“LPA”</u>). To the extent that the Company does not withhold a portion of the Carried Interest Distribution and is required to return capital to the Fund pursuant to the clawback provision of the LPA, Advisor shall pay Advisor’s share of the Company’s clawback obligation, which shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Manager(s), pursuant to Section 7.2(c) of the Operating Agreement.
